  abstract = {A thorough analysis of wheel-terrain interaction is critical to ensure the safe and efficient operation of space rovers on extraterrestrial surfaces like the Moon or Mars. This paper presents an approach for developing and experimentally validating a virtual wheel-terrain interaction model for the UAE Rashid rover. The model aims to improve the fidelity and capability of current simulation methods for space rovers and facilitate the design, evaluation, and control of their locomotion systems. The proposed method considers various factors, such as wheel grouser properties, wheel slippage, loose soil properties, and interaction mechanics. The model accuracy was validated through experiments on a Test-rig testbed that simulated lunar soil conditions. In specific, a set of experiments was carried out to test the behaviors acted on a Grouser-Rashid rover wheel by the lunar soil with different slip ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed simulation method provides a more accurate and realistic simulation of the wheel-terrain interaction behavior and provides insight into the overall performance of the rover},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2017 ESA and CNES. A spectrometer for combined Raman and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is amongst the different instruments that have been pre-selected for the Pasteur payload of the ExoMars rover. It is regarded as a fundamental, next-generation instrument for organic, mineralogical and elemental characterisation of Martian soil, rock samples and organic molecules. Raman spectroscopy and LIBS will be integrated into a single instrument sharing many hardware commonalities [1]. The combined Raman / LIBS instrument has been recommended as the highest priority mineralogy instrument to be included in the rover's analytical laboratory for the following tasks: Analyse surface and sub-surface soil and rocks on Mars, identify organics in the search for life and determine soil origin  \&  toxicity. The synergy of the system is evident: the Raman spectrometer is dedicated to molecular analysis of organics and minerals; the LIBS provides information on the sample's elemental composition. An international team, under ESA contract and with the leadership of TNO Science and Industry, has built and tested an Elegant Bread Board (EBB) of the combined Raman / LIBS instrument. The EBB comprises a specifically designed, extremely compact, spectrometer with high resolution over a large wavelength range, suitable for both Raman spectroscopy and LIBS measurements. The EBB also includes lasers, illumination and imaging optics as well as fibre optics for light transfer. A summary of the functional and environmental requirements together with a description of the optical design and its expected performance are described in [2]. The EBB was developed and constructed to verify the instruments' end-to-end functional performance with natural samples. The combined Raman / LIBS EBB realisation and test results of natural samples will be presented. For the Flight Model (FM) instrument, currently in the design phase, the Netherlands will be responsible for the design, development and verification of the spectrometer unit, while the UK provides the detector. The differences between the EBB and the FM will be demonstrated.}

Yet, many sites of interest are inaccessible to state-of-the-art planetary exploration robots because of the robots' inability to traverse steep slopes, unstructured terrain, and loose soil. In addition, current single-robot approaches only allow a limited exploration speed and a single set of skills. Here, we present a team of legged robots with complementary skills for exploration missions in challenging planetary analog environments. We equipped the robots with an efficient locomotion controller, a mapping pipeline for online and postmission visualization, instance segmentation to highlight scientific targets, and scientific instruments for remote and in situ investigation. Furthermore, we integrated a robotic arm on one of the robots to enable high-precision measurements. Legged robots can swiftly navigate representative terrains, such as granular slopes beyond 25{$^\circ$}, loose soil, and unstructured terrain, highlighting their advantages compared with wheeled rover systems. We successfully verified the approach in analog deployments at the Beyond Gravity ExoMars rover test bed, in a quarry in Switzerland, and at the Space Resources Challenge in Luxembourg. Our results show that a team of legged robots with advanced locomotion, perception, and measurement skills, as well as task-level autonomy, can conduct successful, effective missions in a short time. Our approach enables the scientific exploration of planetary target sites that are currently out of human and robotic reach.},

  abstract = {A crucial aspect in rowing is having a synchronized, highly-efficient stroke. This is very difficult to obtain, due to the many interacting factors that each rower of the crew must perceive. Having a system that monitors and represents the crew coordination would be of great help to the coach during training sessions. In the literature, some methods already employ wireless sensors for capturing motion patterns that affect rowing performance. A challenging problem is to support the coach's decisions at his same level of knowledge, using a limited number of sensors and avoiding the complexity of the biomechanical analysis of human movements. In this paper, we present a multi-agent information-processing system for on-water measuring of both the overall crew asynchrony and the individual rower asynchrony towards the crew. More specifically, in the system, the first level of processing is managed by marking agents, which release marks in a sensing space, according to the rowers' motion. The accumulation of marks enables a stigmergic cooperation mechanism, generating collective marks, i.e., short-term memory structures in the sensing space. At the second level of processing, information provided by marks is observed by similarity agents, which associate a similarity degree with respect to optimal marks. Finally, the third level is managed by granulation agents, which extract asynchrony indicators for different purposes. The effectiveness of the system has been experimented on real-world scenarios. The study includes the problem statement and its characterization in the literature, as well as the proposed solving approach and initial experimental setting. {\copyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.}

The navigation requirements of these missions demand a control architecture featuring autonomous capabilities to achieve a fast and long traverse. The proposed solution presents a twolevel architecture where the efficient navigation (lower) level is always active and the full navigation (upper) level is enabled according to the difficulty of the terrain. The first level is an efficient implementation of the basic functionalities for autonomous navigation based on hazard detection, local path replanning, and trajectory control with visual odometry. The second level implements an adaptive SLAM algorithm that improves the relative localization, evaluates the traversability of the terrain ahead for a more optimal path planning, and performs global (absolute) localization that corrects the pose drift during longer traverses. The architecture provides a solution for long-range, low supervision, and fast planetary exploration. Both navigation levels have been validated on planetary analog field test campaigns.},

  abstract = {The use of analytical techniques is important and critical in all areas related to REE, such as basic fundamental research, exploration, mining, extraction, and metallurgical activities at different stages by different industries. At every stage of these activities, rock, ore, minerals, and other related materials have to be analyzed for their REE contents in terms of elemental, isotopic, and mineralogical concentrations using different analytical techniques. Spectacular developments have taken place in the area of analytical instrumentation during the last four decades, with some of them having shrunk in size and become handheld. Among laboratory-based techniques, F-AAS, GF-AAS, ICP-OES, and MP-AES have become very popular. Because of high sensitivity, fewer interference effects, and ease of use, ICP-MS techniques, such as quadrupole ICP-MS, ICP-MS/MS, ICP-TOF-MS, MH-ICP-MS, HR-ICP-MS, and MC-ICP-MS, with both solution nebulization as well as direct solid analysis using laser ablation sample introduction methods, have become more popular for REE analysis. For direct analysis of solids, INAA, XRF, and LIBS techniques, as well as LA-based ICP-MS techniques, are being extensively utilized. The LIBS technique in particular requires little to no sample preparation. TIMS, SIMS, and SHRIMP techniques are being used for isotopic as well as dating REE depots. Portable analytical techniques, such as pXRF, pLIBS, and Raman spectrometers are able to perform in situ analysis even in the field, helping to make fast decisions during exploration studies. At present, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques including handheld, drone, and satellite-based techniques have become very popular in REE exploration studies because of their ability to cover larger areas in a limited time and, thus, became very cost-effective. Deployment of microanalytical devices/sensors mounted in remotely operated vehicles (ROV) is being successfully utilized in detecting REE-rich deposits in the deep oceans. Providing updated in-depth information on all these important aspects with suitable examples, especially from the point of view of REE research studies is the focal point of this review article.},

  abstract = {Geologically recent small gullies on Mars display morphologies consistent with erosion by water or by debris flows. Suggested formation models are divided into two main categories: (1) groundwater or (2) melting of near-surface ice/snow sourced from the atmosphere. We have measured location and orientation and recorded the local contexts of gullies to constrain the likely models of gully formation. More than 22,000 Mars Orbiter Camera Narrow Angle (MOC NA) and {$>$}120 Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images in the southern hemisphere were searched for gullies. Discrete gullied slope sections with consistent orientation were recorded rather than individual gullies. Slope setting (impact crater, valley wall, etc.), location, and orientation were recorded for each slope section. More than 750 MOC images with gullies ({$>$}900 distinct gullied slope sections) and more than 40 HRSC images ({$>$}380 distinct gullied slope sections) were identified. From both MOC and HRSC, gullies were found to be most common between -30 and -50 degrees latitude and to have an overall pole facing preference. The preferred gully orientation for HRSC is southeast rather than south in MOC, owing to illumination effects that make gullies difficult to detect on south- to southwest-facing slopes in HRSC. In both MOC and HRSC surveys, higher-latitude gullies show less preference for pole facing than those at mid latitudes. Both data sets produced similar results, demonstrating that our data are reliable. We suggest that the observed latitudinal and orientation distributions of gullies show that insolation and atmospheric conditions play a key role in gully formation.},

  abstract = {IDEFIX is a 25 kg four-wheeled rover that will explore the surface of the Martian Moon Phobos in 2027. The rover is jointly developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and will be brought to Phobos within the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Martian Moon eXploration (MMX) mission. Being the world's first wheeled system to drive in milli-gravity, IDEFIX's locomotion deserves special attention. This paper gives an overview of the locomotion subsystem (LSS) of the rover, which is entirely developed and built by the Robotics and Mechatronics Center of DLR (DLR-RMC). A representative LSS, mounted on an IDEFIX prototype, is shown in Figure 1. The LSS is tailored to the needs for the IDEFIX rover and the most important, sizing challenges and functional requirements are summarized. It is then shown how the final flight model (FM) design answers to these requirements. The assembly, integration and testing (AIT) with respect to the LSS consists of several steps of integration and testing at different facilities as well as a comprehensive test sequence once the rover is mostly integrated. Since the LSS is an important, interconnected and the functionally most complex subsystem of the rover, some functionalities could only be tested once the LSS was integrated into IDEFIX. These AIT aspects are therefore summarized in this paper as well.}

We are interested in smart glasses because they have the advantage of providing a simultaneous view of both physical and digital worlds. Despite this potential, pointing task on smart glasses is not really widespread. In this paper, we compared four interaction techniques for selecting targets : (a) the Absolute Head Movement and (b) the Relative Head Movement, where head movement controls the cursor on smart glasses in absolute or relative way, (c) the Absolute Free Hand interaction, where the forefinger control the cursor and (d) the Tactile Surface interaction, where the user controls the cursor via a small touchpad connected to smart glasses. We conducted an experiment with 18 participants. The Tactile Surface and Absolute Head Movement were the most efficient. The Relative Head Movement and Absolute Free Hand interactions were promising and require more exploration for other tasks.}

Mastcam-Z consists of a pair of focusable, 4:1 zoomable cameras that provide broadband red/green/blue and narrowband 400-1000~nm color imaging with fields of view from 25.6{$^\circ$}\,{\texttimes}\,19.2{$^\circ$} (26~mm focal length at 283~{$\mu$}rad/pixel) to 6.2{$^\circ$}\,{\texttimes}\,4.6{$^\circ$} (110~mm focal length at 67.4~{$\mu$}rad/pixel). The cameras can resolve ({$\geq$} 5 pixels) {$\sim$}0.7~mm features at 2~m and {$\sim$}3.3~cm features at 100~m distance. Mastcam-Z shares significant heritage with the Mastcam instruments on the Mars Science Laboratory               Curiosity               rover. Each Mastcam-Z camera consists of zoom, focus, and filter wheel mechanisms and a 1648\,{\texttimes}\,1214 pixel charge-coupled device detector and electronics. The two Mastcam-Z cameras are mounted with a 24.4~cm stereo baseline and 2.3{$^\circ$} total toe-in on a camera plate {$\sim$}2~m above the surface on the rover's Remote Sensing Mast, which provides azimuth and elevation actuation. A separate digital electronics assembly inside the rover provides power, data processing and storage, and the interface to the rover computer. Primary and secondary Mastcam-Z calibration targets mounted on the rover top deck enable tactical reflectance calibration. Mastcam-Z multispectral, stereo, and panoramic images will be used to provide detailed morphology, topography, and geologic context along the rover's traverse; constrain mineralogic, photometric, and physical properties of surface materials; monitor and characterize atmospheric and astronomical phenomena; and document the rover's sample extraction and caching locations. Mastcam-Z images will also provide key engineering information to support sample selection and other rover driving and tool/instrument operations decisions.},

  abstract = {The Panoramic Camera (Pancam) investigation is part of the Athena science payload launched to Mars in 2003 on NASA's twin Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions. The scientific goals of the Pancam investigation are to assess the high-resolution morphology, topography, and geologic context of each MER landing site, to obtain color images to constrain the mineralogic, photometric, and physical properties of surface materials, and to determine dust and aerosol opacity and physical properties from direct imaging of the Sun and sky. Pancam also provides mission support measurements for the rovers, including Sun-finding for rover navigation, hazard identification and digital terrain modeling to help guide long-term rover traverse decisions, high-resolution imaging to help guide the selection of in situ sampling targets, and acquisition of education and public outreach products. The Pancam optical, mechanical, and electronics design were optimized to achieve these science and mission support goals. Pancam is a multispectral, stereoscopic, panoramic imaging system consisting of two digital cameras mounted on a mast 1.5 m above the Martian surface. The mast allows Pancam to image the full 360{$^\circ$} in azimuth and {\textpm}90{$^\circ$} in elevation. Each Pancam camera utilizes a 1024 {\texttimes} 1024 active imaging area frame transfer CCD detector array. The Pancam optics have an effective focal length of 43 mm and a focal ratio of               f               /20, yielding an instantaneous field of view of 0.27 mrad/pixel and a field of view of 16{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 16{$^\circ$}. Each rover's two Pancam ``eyes'' are separated by 30 cm and have a 1{$^\circ$} toe-in to provide adequate stereo parallax. Each eye also includes a small eight position filter wheel to allow surface mineralogic studies, multispectral sky imaging, and direct Sun imaging in the 400--1100 nm wavelength region. Pancam was designed and calibrated to operate within specifications on Mars at temperatures from -55{$^\circ$} to +5{$^\circ$}C. An onboard calibration target and fiducial marks provide the capability to validate the radiometric and geometric calibration on Mars.},

The left Mastcam (M-34) has a 34~mm focal length, an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 0.22~mrad, and a FOV of 20{$^\circ~\times~$}15{$^\circ$} over the full 1648~{\texttimes}~1200 pixel span of its Kodak KAI-2020 CCD. The right Mastcam (M-100) has a 100~mm focal length, an IFOV of 0.074~mrad, and a FOV of 6.8{$^\circ~\times~$}5.1{$^\circ$} using the same detector. The cameras are separated by 24.2~cm on the mast, allowing stereo images to be obtained at the resolution of the M-34 camera. Each camera has an eight-position filter wheel, enabling it to take Bayer pattern red, green, and blue (RGB) ``true color'' images, multispectral images in nine additional bands spanning {\textasciitilde}400--1100~nm, and images of the Sun in two colors through neutral density-coated filters. An associated Digital Electronics Assembly provides command and data interfaces to the rover, 8~Gb of image storage per camera, 11~bit to 8~bit companding, JPEG compression, and acquisition of high-definition video. Here we describe the preflight and in-flight calibration of Mastcam images, the ways that they are being archived in the NASA Planetary Data System, and the ways that calibration refinements are being developed as the investigation progresses on Mars.

  abstract = {The emergent technology of Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), which combines heterogeneous computing with the high performance of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is a very interesting platform for a huge number of applications ranging from medical imaging and augmented reality to high-performance computing in space. In this paper, we focus on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ EG Heterogeneous MPSoC, which is composed of four different processing elements (PE): a dual-core Cortex-R5, a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53, a graphics processing unit (GPU) and a high end FPGA. Proper use of the heterogeneity and the different levels of parallelism of this platform becomes a challenging task. This paper evaluates this platform and each of its PEs to carry out fundamental operations in terms of computational performance. To this end, we evaluate image-based applications and a matrix multiplication kernel. On former, the image-based applications leverage the heterogeneity of the MPSoc and strategically distributes its tasks among both kinds of CPU cores and the FPGA. On the latter, we analyze separately each PE using different matrix multiplication benchmarks in order to assess and compare their performance in terms of MFlops. This kind of operations are being carried out for example in a large number of space-related applications where the MPSoCs are currently gaining momentum. Results stand out the fact that different PEs can collaborate efficiently with the aim of accelerating the computational-demanding tasks of an application. Another important aspect to highlight is that leveraging the parallel OpenBLAS library we achieve up to 12 GFlops with the four Cortex-A53 cores of the platform, which is a considerable performance for this kind of devices.}

SHERLOC has two primary boresights. The Spectroscopy boresight generates spatially resolved chemical maps using fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy coupled to microscopic images (10.1~{$\mu$}m/pixel). The second boresight is a Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering (WATSON); a copy of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) that obtains color images from microscopic scales ({$\sim$}13~{$\mu$}m/pixel) to infinity. SHERLOC Spectroscopy focuses a 40~{$\mu$}s pulsed deep UV neon-copper laser (248.6 nm), to a {$\sim$}100~{$\mu$}m spot on a target at a working distance of {$\sim$}48 mm. Fluorescence emissions from organics, and Raman scattered photons from organics and minerals, are spectrally resolved with a single diffractive grating spectrograph with a spectral range of 250 to {$\sim$}370 nm. Because the fluorescence and Raman regions are naturally separated with deep UV excitation ({$<$}250 nm), the Raman region {$\sim$} 800 -- 4000 cm               -1               (250 to 273 nm) and the fluorescence region (274 to {$\sim$}370 nm) are acquired simultaneously without time gating or additional mechanisms. SHERLOC science begins by using an Autofocus Context Imager (ACI) to obtain target focus and acquire 10.1~{$\mu$}m/pixel greyscale images. Chemical maps of organic and mineral signatures are acquired by the orchestration of an internal scanning mirror that moves the focused laser spot across discrete points on the target surface where spectra are captured on the spectrometer detector. ACI images and chemical maps ({$<$} 100~{$\mu$}m/mapping pixel) will enable the first Mars               in situ               view of the spatial distribution and interaction between organics, minerals, and chemicals important to the assessment of potential biogenicity (containing CHNOPS). Single robotic arm placement chemical maps can cover areas up to 7x7 mm in area and, with the {$<$} 10 min acquisition time per map, larger mosaics are possible with arm movements. This microscopic view of the organic geochemistry of a target at the               Perseverance               field site, when combined with the other instruments, such as Mastcam-Z, PIXL, and SuperCam, will enable unprecedented analysis of geological materials for both scientific research and determination of which samples to collect and cache for Mars sample return.},

  abstract = {Mapping can potentially be speeded up in a significant way by using multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m0, the search algorithm transforms m0 by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m0. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions. Results from experiments with up to six robots are presented based on simulated as well as real-world map data.},

However development has lagged behind terrestrial applications for several reasons: space qualified computers have significantly less processing power than their terrestrial equivalents, reliability requirements are more stringent than the majority of applications deep-learning is being used for. The long requirements, design and qualification cycles in much of the space industry slows adoption of recent developments. GPUs are the first hardware choice for implementing neural networks on terrestrial computers, however no radiation hardened equivalent parts are currently available. Field Programmable Gate Array devices are capable of efficiently implementing neural networks and radiation hardened parts are available, however the process to deploy and validate an inference network is non-trivial and robust tools that automate the process are not available. We present an open source tool chain that can automatically deploy a trained inference network from the TensorFlow framework directly to the LEON 3, and an industrial case study of the design process used to train and optimise a deep-learning model for this processor. This does not directly change the three challenges described above however it greatly accelerates prototyping and analysis of neural network solutions, allowing these options to be more easily considered than is currently possible. Future improvements to the tools are identified along with a summary of some of the obstacles to using neural networks and potential solutions to these in the future.}

  abstract = {Driven by endeavors towards Industry 4.0, there is increasing interest in augmented reality (AR) as an approach for assistance in areas like picking, assembly and maintenance. In this work our focus is on AR-based assistance in manual assembly. The design space for AR instructions in this context includes, e.g., side-by-side, 3D or projected 2D presentations. In previous research, the low quality of the AR devices available at the respective time had a significant impact on performance evaluations. Today, a proper and up-to-date comparison of different presentation approaches is missing. This paper presents an improved 3D in-situ instruction and compares it to previously presented techniques. All instructions are implemented on up-to-date AR hardware, namely the Microsoft HoloLens. To support reproducible research, the comparison is made using a standardized benchmark scenario. The results show, contrary to previous research, that in-situ instructions on state-of-the-art AR glasses outperform side-by-side instructions in terms of errors made, task completion time, and perceived task load.}

  abstract = {Abstract             The lunar south polar region is an area of interest geologically, and so it is a target for many future missions. These target areas are being investigated in detail, particularly in relation to the illumination conditions, Earth visibility, thermal conditions, and their accessibility. Many of the target areas are thermally interesting as they contain permanently shadowed regions, which are colder than surrounding terrain and therefore potentially harbor volatiles. Understanding the hazards present including craters and boulders within these target areas is critical for a successful mission. Using multiple data sets including Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera images, hazard mapping has been carried out across two areas of interest: CR1 located on the Connecting Ridge between the Shackleton and de Gerlache crater and GR1 located on the de Gerlache crater rim. The hazard mapping was compared to illumination maps, Earth visibility maps, slope maps, and thermal data sets to understand if there are suitable sampling areas. Two potential traverses for both CR1 and GR1 have been identified (one extended and one short). The traverses can be performed within a short mission time frame by either astronauts or by a rover and have multiple sampling points of boulders of geological interest and thermally cold areas for volatile sampling. To ensure maximum scientific return from CR1, GR1, and the surrounding areas, we suggest future missions collaborate with each other when targeting these sites. This will ensure the lunar surface is shared between missions, space agencies, and commercial companies.}

A number of aspects of the technique have been explored and some potential improvements suggested. Autocorrelation is just one suitable statistical method sensitive to the grain-size of sediment in digital images; four additional techniques are presented and their relative merits discussed. A collective suite of techniques applicable to the general problem of grain-size estimation from digital images of sediment might broaden the applicability to more sedimentary environments, as well as improve its accuracy. These techniques are compared using a large data set from a gravel barrier beach in southern England. Based on over 180 samples, mean grain-size of sieved and imaged sediments correspond to within between 8\% and 16\%. Some theoretical aspects of the spatial arrangement of image intensity in digital images of natural sediments are addressed, including the fractal nature of sediments in images, which has potential implications for derivation of grain-size distributions from images of sand-sized material through segmentation and thresholding. The methods outlined in this contribution may also find application in further uncovering the geometric structure of sediment beds, as well as in the simulation of sedimentation processes.},

The model is tested on a dataset consisting of 409 images and associated detailed label data. The data are from a much wider sedimentological spectrum than previous optical granulometry studies, consisting of both well- and poorly sorted sediment, terrigenous, carbonate, and volcaniclastic sands and gravels and their mixtures, and grain sizes spanning over two orders of magnitude. I demonstrate the model framework by configuring it in several ways, to estimate two categories (describing grain shape and population, respectively) and nine numeric grain size percentiles in pixels from a single input image. Grain size is then recovered using the physical size of a pixel. Finally, I demonstrate that the model can be configured and trained to estimate equivalent sieve diameters directly from image features, without the need for area-to-mass conversion formulas and without even knowing the scale of one pixel. Thus it is the only optical granulometry method proposed to date that does not necessarily require image scaling. The flexibility of the model framework should facilitate numerous application in the spatiotemporal monitoring of the grain size distribution, shape, mineralogy and other quantities of interest of sedimentary deposits as they evolve, as well as other texture-based proxies extracted from remotely sensed imagery. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained with images rendered from a digital terrain map (DTM) can provide a way to side-step the issue of unknown or complex dynamics while still providing reliable autonomous navigation by directly mapping an image to position. The portability of trained CNNs allows offline training that can yield a matured network capable of being loaded onto a spacecraft for real-time position acquisition.}

To solve this problem, an optimal path planning algorithm for USV based on fast marching method (FMM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a arrival time potential field with the only minimum point is generated by executing FMM on the initial binary map, which is used as a basic model for path planning. Secondly, to modeling the safety and heading angle constraints of the vehicle, the saturated safety map based on SFMS and the virtual obstacles formed by USV's turning ability are introduced and applied respectively. Thirdly, the gradient descent method is used on the improved potential field to search out an optimal path that can well meet the actual constrains of USV. The effectiveness and rationality of the algorithm are then verified by simulations.},

Here, we describe the tremendous growth in space robotics missions in the past 7 years, with many new entities participating in missions to the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. We also describe the recent development of aerial missions to planets and moons, as exemplified by the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars and the Dragonfly mission to Titan.

In situ Raman spectroscopy on Phobos is an important tool to achieve the scientific objectives of the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission, and maximize the scientific merit of the sample return by characterizing the mineral composition and heterogeneity of the surface of Phobos. Conducting in situ Raman spectroscopy in the harsh environment of Phobos requires a very sensitive, compact, lightweight, and robust instrument that can be carried by the compact MMX rover. In this context, the Raman spectrometer for MMX (i.e., RAX) is currently under development via international collaboration between teams from Japan, Germany, and Spain. To demonstrate the capability of a compact Raman system such as RAX, we built an instrument that reproduces the optical performance of the flight model using commercial off-the-shelf parts. Using this performance model, we measured mineral samples relevant to Phobos and Mars, such as anhydrous silicates, carbonates, and hydrous minerals. Our measurements indicate that such minerals can be accurately identified using a RAX-like Raman spectrometer. We demonstrated a spectral resolution of approximately 10~cm               -1               , high enough to resolve the strongest olivine Raman bands at {\textasciitilde}\,820 and {\textasciitilde}\,850~cm               -1               , with highly sensitive Raman peak measurements (e.g., signal-to-noise ratios up to 100). These results strongly suggest that the RAX instrument will be capable of determining the minerals expected on the surface of Phobos, adding valuable information to address the question of the moon's origin, heterogeneity, and circum-Mars material transport.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the following relevant wireless technologies: IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4-oriented, and Sub-GHz-based LoRa. Our goal is to highlight how various communication technologies may be suitable for mesh networking, either providing a native support or being adapted subsequently. Hence, we discuss how these wireless technologies, being either standard or proprietary, can adapt to IoT scenarios (e.g., smart cities and smart agriculture) in which the heterogeneity of the involved devices is a key feature. Finally, we provide reference use cases involving all the analyzed mesh-oriented technologies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. A large component of the building material concrete consists of aggregate with varying particle sizes between 0.125 and 32 mm. Its actual size distribution significantly affects the quality characteristics of the final concrete in both, the fresh and hardened states. The usually unknown variations in the size distribution of the aggregate particles, which can be large especially when using recycled aggregate materials, are typically compensated by an increased usage of cement which, however, has severe negative impacts on economical and ecological aspects of the concrete production. In order to allow a precise control of the target properties of the concrete, unknown variations in the size distribution have to be quantified to enable a proper adaptation of the concrete's mixture design in real time. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning based method for the determination of concrete aggregate grading curves. In this context, we propose a network architecture applying multi-scale feature extraction modules in order to handle the strongly diverse object sizes of the particles. Furthermore, we propose and publish a novel dataset of concrete aggregate used for the quantitative evaluation of our method.},

In this study, we examined the suitability of the Microsoft HoloLens mixed-reality headset for creating locomotor interactions in real-world environments enriched with 3D holographic obstacles. In Experiment 1, we compared the obstacle-avoidance maneuvers of 12 participants stepping over either real or holographic obstacles of different heights and depths. Participants' avoidance maneuvers were recorded with three spatially and temporally integrated Kinect v2 sensors. Similar to real obstacles, holographic obstacles elicited obstacle-avoidance maneuvers that scaled with obstacle dimensions. However, with holographic obstacles, some participants showed dissimilar trail or lead foot obstacle-avoidance maneuvers compared to real obstacles: they either consistently failed to raise their trail foot or crossed the obstacle with extreme lead-foot margins. In Experiment 2, we examined the efficacy of mixed-reality video feedback in altering such dissimilar avoidance maneuvers. Participants quickly adjusted their trail-foot crossing height and gradually lowered extreme lead-foot crossing heights in the course of mixed-reality video feedback trials, and these improvements were largely retained in subsequent trials without feedback. Participant-specific differences in real and holographic obstacle avoidance notwithstanding, the present results suggest that 3D holographic obstacles supplemented with mixed-reality video feedback may be used for studying and perhaps also training 3D obstacle avoidance.},

Another way proposed in this paper is a prior scanning of object of interest with an application aimed for Vuforia plugin. Both concepts use close cooperation with user-friendly environment for developing of mixed reality applications -- Unity. We present and discuss examples in this article. The area of precise location for mixed reality (augmented reality mixed with real reality in a way that one can interact witch each other) is of paramount importance. If we know precise position of virtual objects in the scene and precise position of the device in the scene, we can alleviate the burden of massive computing within HoloLens. As a result, we gain better experience from mixed reality.},

  abstract = {Previous Mars and Moon rover missions have highlighted a limitation in mobility, with surface rovers traversing only a few tens of meters per day, at speeds in the order of 10 cm/s. This limitation can be primarily attributed to the rover locomotion system from one side, and on the other by the lack/limited on-board autonomous capabilities. To address these limitations, ESA issued a series of activities on fast autonomous rovers. GMV is leading the RAPID and FASTNAV projects, aiming at developing a semi-autonomous rover capable of safely traversing lunar terrains at high speeds (around 1 m/s), using a visual navigation based Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system. The RAPID project was the foundation of this work, in which the rover platform was designed, manufactured, and a first version of the on-board software was developed. The follow-up FASTNAV project builds upon the work of RAPID to establish an innovative multi-mode continuous drive GNC system. This new architecture aims to achieve an improved autonomy and faster speeds, with different guidance modes selected according to the terrain type, using a combination of techniques (AI and classical computer vision), while also improving the existing GNC algorithms. This paper shall present the experience obtained during the development of the rover platform and the GNC system across both activities. It shall provide an overview of the challenges and risks, the decisions made, a detailed technical overview of the GNC architecture and components, and the results observed during the analogue field tests.},

These spectroscopic techniques, in single and multi-modes, are widely accepted as an efficient tool to retrieve information from atomic and molecular systems such as knowledge on chemical bonds, molecular structure and geometry, interactions and related mechanisms etc. Analytical capabilities of such systems which combine LIBS, Raman, and LIF are highly desirable since one can acquire complementary information from the same sample enabling a remarkable potential for various applications in diverse fields like archeology, mineralogy, planetary explorations, clinical chemistry, biomedical and environmental monitoring etc to extract more information. In this review, attention has been devoted to the works of combined LIBS-LIF-Raman technique in different fields and its significance, along with brief discussions on other combinations like LIBS-Raman, LIBS-LIF, and Raman-LIF.}

This state of the art, dexterous, anthropomorphic robotic torso has significant technical improvements over its predecessor making it a far more valuable tool for astronauts. Upgrades include: increased force sensing, greater range of motion, higher bandwidth, and improved dexterity. R2's integrated mechatronic design results in a more compact and robust distributed control system with a fraction of the wiring of the original Robonaut. Modularity is prevalent throughout the hardware and software along with innovative and layered approaches for sensing and control. The most important aspects of the Robonaut philosophy are clearly present in this latest model's ability to allow comfortable human interaction and in its design to perform significant work using the same hardware and interfaces used by people. The following describes the mechanisms, integrated electronics, control strategies, and user interface that make R2 a promising addition to the Space Station and other environments where humanoid robots can assist people.},

  abstract = {The lunar nearside has been investigated by many uncrewed and crewed missions, but the farside of the Moon remains poorly known. Lunar farside exploration is challenging because maneuvering rovers with efficient locomotion in harsh extraterrestrial environment is necessary to explore geological characteristics of scientific interest. Chang'E-4 mission successfully targeted the Moon's farside and deployed a teleoperated rover (Yutu-2) to explore inside the Von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n crater, conveying rich information regarding regolith, craters, and rocks. Here, we report mobile exploration on the lunar farside with Yutu-2 over the initial 2 years. During its journey, Yutu-2 has experienced varying degrees of mild slip and skid, indicating that the terrain is relatively flat at large scales but scattered with local gentle slopes. Cloddy soil sticking on its wheels implies a greater cohesion of the lunar soil than encountered at other lunar landing sites. Further identification results indicate that the regolith resembles dry sand and sandy loam on Earth in bearing properties, demonstrating greater bearing strength than that identified during the Apollo missions. In sharp contrast to the sparsity of rocks along the traverse route, small fresh craters with unilateral moldable ejecta are abundant, and some of them contain high-reflectance materials at the bottom, suggestive of secondary impact events. These findings hint at notable differences in the surface geology between the lunar farside and nearside. Experience gained with Yutu-2 improves the understanding of the farside of the Moon, which, in return, may lead to locomotion with improved efficiency and larger range.            ,               Yutu-2 conducted in situ exploration on the lunar farside, yielding insights into lunar regolith, craters, and rocks.},

Each node may be randomly distributed in a monitoring area, reflecting the network event of tracking in ZigBee network applications. This paper presents the development and coverage evaluation of a ZigBee-based wireless network application. A stack structure node available for home service integration is proposed, and all data of sensing nodes with an adaptive weighted fusion (AWF) processing are passed to the gateway and through the gateway to reexecute packet processing and then reported to the monitoring center, which effectively optimize the wireless network to the scale of the data processing efficiency. The linear interpolation theory is used for background graphical user interface so as to evaluate the working status of each node and the whole network coverage case. A testbed has been created for validating the basic functions of the proposed ZigBee-based home network system. Network coverage capabilities were tested, and packet loss and energy saving of the proposed system in longtime wireless network monitoring tasks were also verified.},

A total of 17 geological structures were systematically identified within the landing area. Additionally, focusing on scientific questions regarding the evolution of troughs, cone units, and mesas, we theoretically designed an exploration route considering slope constraints by taking the Zhurong rover route design as a case study. This route, a conceptual design, starts from the hibernation location of the Zhurong rover and has a total length of 126 km. It can provide a reference for advancing detection strategies for volatile components (e.g., water and ice) and contribute to the design of the Tianwen-3 exploration route. Ultimately, this study aims to establish a general guideline for integrating geological mapping with rover mobility planning in future extraterrestrial exploration missions.},

We investigated the effects of different exploration strategies that make use of rover science autonomy and compared the operational efficiency and science yield of three geological exploration scenarios: (1) standard human-directed exploration, (2) rover-directed exploration, and (3) astronaut/rover collaborative exploration. We show that exploration with a rover capable of science autonomy is operationally more efficient than the human-directed strategy, resulting in higher rates of data collection and hence a greater science yield per command cycle. Additionally, we explored and developed astronaut/rover collaborative exploration strategies and present a basic framework for effective planetary exploration that leverages the expertise of a science team, the efficiency of a science-autonomous rover, and the contextual abilities of astronauts.},

  abstract = {Exploration of lava caves on the surface of planetary bodies near Earth is of high importance for scientific research and space exploration. The natural shielding that these caves offer against radiation and small meteorites makes them well suited for preserving exobiological signatures and protecting human-made facilities. The use of a robot team arises as the safest and most cost-efficient way to explore extraterrestrial lava caves because they are difficult to access. Although the approach has been demonstrated in similar scenarios on Earth, its adaptation to space conditions needs further research. Here, we define a lava cave exploration mission concept, including four mission phases that are performed by a heterogeneous team of three robots equipped with the required hardware and software. This mission concept was validated in a relevant scenario, a lava cave on Lanzarote island (Spain), where the team of robots was able to build a three-dimensional model of the surrounding area and skylight, introducing a scout rover through rappelling and exploring the inner part of the cave. The results obtained demonstrate the proposed mission concept's feasibility, including three next-generation planetary exploration rovers that were coordinated to obtain meaningful information about the lava cave's external and internal morphology.           ,              A cooperative and heterogeneous robot team explored a lava cave in a relevant planetary exploration scenario.},

  abstract = {Currently, LoRa technology is one of the most promising technologies in satellite Internet of Things. Particularly those based on satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, including the CubeSat nanosatellite constellations. However, the LoRa specification does not contain clear criteria for the applicability of the LoRa modulation under strong Doppler effect conditions caused by the very high speed of satellites. This is especially true in the case of the dynamic Doppler effect when the Doppler frequency shift changes rapidly with time. This paper presents the results of laboratory testing and outdoor experiments conducted to determine the feasibility of the LoRa modulation in CubeSat radio communication systems. Additionally, possible restrictions associated with the Doppler effect were explored. The experiments showed that the LoRa modulation has very high immunity to the Doppler effect. This immunity allows for the use of LoRa modulation in satellite radio communications in orbits above 550 km without any restrictions associated with the Doppler effect. In lower orbits, the dynamic Doppler effect leads to the destruction of the satellite-to-Earth radio channel when using the LoRa modulation mode with a maximum spreading factor of SF = 12. This destruction occurs when the satellite is flying directly above the ground station, resulting in reduced duration of the radio communication session. The reduction in the duration of a communication session increases with decreasing orbit altitude and reaches about one minute in an ultra-low orbit 200 km high.}

The permittivity of lunar material is one of the important parameters for interpreting radar data and can also be obtained by LPR. In this paper, we use the metal plate reflection method based on LPR data and panoramic camera (PC) data to estimate the relative permittivity distribution of 1373m route during the first 53 lunar days.

Our experimental results show that the sensor produces data accurate enough to be used for servoing, even in the presence of noise generated when the drone is not being completely stable. Our results also show that appropriate filtering of the signals is needed and that to produce correct results, it is very important to keep the wind turbine within the field of vision of both cameras, so that both deep neural networks could detect it.}

  abstract = {Rovers are one of the options for acquiring surface information which would allow human exploration of planetary bodies. Our limited knowledge derived from the Viking landers and the Apollo and Surveyor programs indicate that Mars and the Moon possess rocky and sandy terrain. Any rovers sent there must therefore exhibit a high degree of mobility. This thesis develops a two-dimensional model of slow-speed vehicle mobility performance. Tests were also planned with a full-size vehicle but were not accomplished due to scheduling and technical problems. The scale model was, however, used to correlate the theoretical model with tested performance and validate the use of the two-dimensional quasi-static model.},

With an estimated representative lunar testbed area of approximately 660 m2, a large volume of lunar regolith simulant material is needed for this purpose. In this study, a basanitic sandy silt from a quarry located in the Siebengebirge Volcanic Field is evaluated as a large-volume source of material. The focus of this project has been to conduct a physical and chemical characterisation of the fine-grained material to be used in LUNA; the European Astronaut Centre lunar regolith simulant 1 (EAC-1\,A). The physical characterisation tests undertaken include sphericity, density measurements, cohesion and static angle of repose, with mineralogical investigations via petrographical analysis with optical microscope and SEM, XRF, XRD and DSC measurements. The results of the EAC-1A tests are compared to published data on existing widely used lunar regolith simulants, namely JSC-1A, JSC-2A, NU-LHT-3M, DNA and FJS-1.}

  abstract = {Space Initiatives Inc has been developing small "Mote" ballistic penetrators under Air Force and other contracts to provide commercial support for robotic and crewed operations on and near the Moon. The 1 kg Mote penetrators, each of which has on-board processing, communications and sensors, would be carried within a carrier to be delivered by a dedicated mission or possibly by NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services lander. After deployment by the carrier the Mote would fall ballistically, impacting the surface at up to 300 m/s, penetrating 1 meter or more in most lunar regolith, placing a sensor array spread, in a nominal mission, 1 km over the lunar surface. Ballistic penetrators allow for the rapid initial scientific investigation of difficult to reach terrain such as the polar Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), lava tube pits and skylights, or volcanic vents, or geographically spread areas of interest such as the lunar swirl regions. The planned CLPS landing in the Schr{\"o}dinger Basin impact melt expected in Q2 2024 shows the potential for enhancing lunar research with ballistic penetrators. The impact melt is in the Southern edge of Schr{\"o}dinger crater, roughly 60 km from the PSR in Nefed'ev Crater and 100 km from the apparent volcanic vent forming the Schr{\"o}dinger-G pit. A Mote deployment in Nefed'ev crater would provide geological and compositional data on the icy subsurface material deep in the PSR, while a deployment within or on the rim of the Schr{\"o}dinger-G pit would provide similar data on the pyroclastic material in the vent. In either case the Motes would confirm the ability of the terrain to bear a lander or rover and would provide a initial scientific analysis of the type of icy or volcanic material present in the explored region as a precursor to any subsequent scientific exploration by rovers or astronauts.},

This paper presents a literature survey towards the design of compliant constant velocity universal joints. The traditional constant velocity universal joints available from the literature were studied, classified and their mechanical efficiencies were compared. Also the graph representation of them was studied. In the same manner, literature review for different kind of compliant joints suitable for the Rigid-Body-Replacement of constant velocity universal joints was also performed. For the first time a comparison with analytical data of compliant joints was performed. All of compliant universal joints are non-constant velocity and designed based on rigid Hooke's universal joint. Also we show there are no equivalent compliant joints for some rigid-body joints such as cylindrical joint, planar joint, spherical fork joint and spherical parallelogram quadrilateral joint. However, we may achieve them by combining numbers of available compliant joints. The universal joints found are non-compliant non-constant velocity universal joint, non-compliant constant velocity universal joint or compliant non-constant velocity universal joint. A compliant constant velocity universal joint has a great horizon for developments, for instance in medical or rehabilitation devices.},

Both the size and the orientation of the correlation windows are determined according to the characteristic scale and the dominant direction of the interest points. Experimental results on real images demonstrate that the new method is effective for matching image pairs with significant rotation and scale changes as well as other common imaging conditions.},

This MPSoC is the result of a codesign process and is designed as an ideal platform for software-implemented fault-tolerance measures. It enforces strong isolation between processors, and combines fault-tolerance measures across the embedded stack within an FPGA. This allows us to assure robustness for a satellite on-board computer consisting of modern semiconductors manufactured in fine technology nodes, for which traditional fault-tolerance concepts are ineffective. We successfully implemented this design on several Xilinx UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs with modest utilization. We show that a 4-core implementation is possible with just 1.93 W of total power consumption, which for the first time enables true fault-tolerance for very small spacecraft such as CubeSats. For critical space missions aboard heavier satellites, we implemented an MPSoC-variant for the space-grade XQRKU060 part together with the Xilinx Radiation Testing Consortium. The MPSoC was developed for a 4-year ESA project. It can satisfy the high performance requirements of future scientific and commercial space missions at low cost while offering the strong fault-coverage necessary for platform control for missions with a long duration.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Rovers operating on Mars require more and more autonomous features to fulfill their challenging mission requirements. However, the inherent constraints of space systems render the implementation of complex algorithms an expensive and difficult task. In this paper, we propose an architecture for autonomous navigation. Efficient implementations of autonomous features are built on top of the ExoMars               path following               navigation approach to enhance the safety and traversing capabilities of the rover. These features allow the rover to detect and avoid hazards and perform significantly longer traverses planned by operators on the ground. The efficient navigation approach has been implemented and tested during field test campaigns on a planetary analogue terrain. The experiments evaluated the proposed architecture by autonomously completing several traverses of variable lengths while avoiding hazards. The approach relies only on the optical Localization Cameras stereo bench, a sensor that is found in all current rovers, and potentially allows for computationally inexpensive long-range autonomous navigation in terrains of medium difficulty.},

  abstract = {A novel setup, combining two spectroscopic techniques, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman spectroscopy in a hybrid unit, is described. The work presented herein is part of a broader project that aims to demonstrate the applicability of the hybrid LIBS-Raman unit as an analytical tool for the investigation of samples and objects of cultural heritage. The system utilizes a nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) for both LIBS and Raman analysis. In the Raman mode, a low intensity beam from the laser probes the sample surface and the scattering signal is collected into a grating spectrograph coupled to an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) detector, which records the Raman spectrum. In the LIBS mode a single high intensity pulse from the laser irradiates the sample surface and the time- and spectrally-resolved emission from the resulting laser ablation plume yields the LIBS spectrum. The use of a non-gated CCD detector was found to produce similar quality data (in terms of S/N ratio and fluorescence background) in the Raman mode, while in the LIBS mode spectral features were clearly broader but did not prevent identification of prominent atomic emission lines. Several model pigment samples were examined and the data obtained show the ability of the hybrid unit to record both Raman and LIBS spectra from the same point on the sample, a clear advantage over the use of different analytical setups.}

  abstract = {The Chinese Lunar mission Chang'E-4 soft-landed on the far side of the Moon on January 2019 marking a significant milestone in space exploration. The mission's landing site is on the eastern floor of Von K\&\#225;rm\&\#225;n (VK) crater (45.4446\&\#176;S, 177.5991\&\#176;E), within the South Pole\&\#8211;Aitken (SPA) basin, one of the oldest and largest impact craters in the solar system. Yutu-2 is the rover of the Chang;E-4 mission. Similar to its twin rover Yutu-1, amongst its scientific payloads Yutu-2 carries a set of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems. GPR is a well-established geophysical method and has been instrumental in the new era of planetary exploration. Chang\&\#8217;E-3 was the first mission incorporating in-situ planetary GPR, a trend continued by subsequent Lunar and Martian missions, including Chang'E-4, Perseverance, Chang'E-5 and Tianwen-1; with plans for future missions such as Chang'E-7 and ExoMars [1]. Existing Lunar GPR studies often assume that the dielectric properties of Lunar materials can be modelled via a constant electric permittivity and a conductive term. However, treating the electric permittivity as non-dispersive overlook the frequency-dependent complex electric permittivity of ilmenite. Ilmenite is a titanium mineral, particularly abundant in Lunar mare basalts and soils. Recent investigations [1] using a complex Cole-Cole function have shown that ilmenite-mixtures act as low-pass filters, causing a decrease in the pulse's central frequency as the wave propagates through an ilmenite formation. This frequency shift, proportional to the ilmenite content, serves as a basis for inferring the presence of basalts and approximating their ilmenite content. In this study, we explore the frequency shift of signals received both from Channel-2B and Channel-1. Our analysis reveals a sequence of basaltic layers extending to approximately 300 m depth, displaying varying thickness and ilmenite content. Based on the estimated ilmenite content, the GPR data indicates three distinct phases of Lunar volcanism: an early phase with high-Ti basalts, followed by a low-Ti volcanic activity, and a final phase with high-Ti basalts. These findings align with generic models of Lunar lava emplacement [1]. According to these models, Lunar volcanic history includes an early "blue" titanium-rich volcanic event ({\textasciitilde} 3.8-3.5 Ga), followed by low-Ti "red" basalts ({\textasciitilde} 3.5-3 Ga), and a subsequent phase of "blue" high-Ti basalts ({\textasciitilde}3 Ga) [2].

  abstract = {Abstract             We investigated the age and origin of 41 light plain deposits around the lunar south pole, using LRO data sets and successfully dated 22 of them using crater size-frequency distribution measurements. We find that deposits related to Schr{\"o}dinger basin are {$\sim$}3.8~Ga old, including deposits on the Amundsen crater floor, which we interpret as Schr{\"o}dinger basin ejecta. Six study areas date to {$\sim$}3.7~Ga, which reflect an additional large-scale or basin impact event post-Schr{\"o}dinger - possibly Orientale. An additional two areas with younger isolated ages likely represent local impact sources. Finally, smooth, light plains-like, ejecta deposits around Shackleton crater were found to be Eratosthenian in age. Our findings show that light plain deposits originate from a combination of both basin and local ejecta materials. Thus, samples collected in the region will exhibit a diverse range of basin materials and ages representative of the ejecta from multiple impact events.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The southern polar region of the Moon is the focus of future human exploration missions due to the presence of essential resources like water and the possible capability to sustain a prolonged human presence on the Moon. Thus, it is vital to understand the geologic context of the region for a correct interpretation of returned samples. In this paper, we used the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data sets to investigate the age and origin of 41 smooth deposits around the lunar south pole. Of these, 22 could be accurately dated using the size-frequency distribution of craters, and we found groups of smooth deposits of similar ages that can be related to a one or more source impacts. Some of them are related to the Schr{\"o}dinger basin impact, while others are likely related to the Orientale basin on the farside of the Moon. We also found two deposits of younger age, likely related to fresh nearby craters, and other ejecta deposits that represent the formation age of the Shackleton crater. Therefore, these deposits appear to have formed from both basin/crater ejecta and local materials. Samples collected in this region will exhibit a diverse range of materials and sources from multiple events.           ,              Key Points                                                                Forty-one light plain deposits in the lunar southern polar region are investigated for origin and absolute model age determination                                                     Schr{\"o}dinger basin materials date to {$\sim$}3.8~Ga, Orientale materials to {$\sim$}3.7~Ga and Shackleton impact to {$\sim$}2.4~Ga                                                     Multiple impact events and local sources contributed to light plain deposits across the lunar south pole},

Although the authors introduced simple approximations to describe the complex tribological phenomena during harmonic drive teeth meshing, the numerical results match the trend of experimental evidence. In particular, assuming the harmonic drive working at the rated torque, the plots of the mechanical efficiency versus different parameters such as temperature and angular speed have been simulated.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX) is a Ground Penetrating Radar on the Mars 2020 mission's               Perseverance               rover, which is planned to land near a deltaic landform in Jezero crater. RIMFAX will add a new dimension to rover investigations of Mars by providing the capability to image the shallow subsurface beneath the rover. The principal goals of the RIMFAX investigation are to image subsurface structure, and to provide information regarding subsurface composition. Data provided by RIMFAX will aid Perseverance's mission to explore the ancient habitability of its field area and to select a set of promising geologic samples for analysis, caching, and eventual return to Earth. RIMFAX is a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, which transmits a signal swept through a range of frequencies, rather than a single wide-band pulse. The operating frequency range of 150--1200~MHz covers the typical frequencies of GPR used in geology. In general, the full bandwidth (with effective center frequency of 675~MHz) will be used for shallow imaging down to several meters, and a reduced bandwidth of the lower frequencies (center frequency 375~MHz) will be used for imaging deeper structures. The majority of data will be collected at regular distance intervals whenever the rover is driving, in each of the deep, shallow, and surface modes. Stationary measurements with extended integration times will improve depth range and SNR at select locations. The RIMFAX instrument consists of an electronic unit housed inside the rover body and an antenna mounted externally at the rear of the rover. Several instrument prototypes have been field tested in different geological settings, including glaciers, permafrost sediments, bioherme mound structures in limestone, and sedimentary features in sand dunes. Numerical modelling has provided a first assessment of RIMFAX's imaging potential using parameters simulated for the Jezero crater landing site.},

The multi-population migration genetic algorithm randomly divides a large population into several small with an identical population number. The migration mechanism among the populations is used to replace the screening mechanism of the selection operator. Operations such as the crossover operator and the mutation operator also are improved. Simulation results show that the multi-population migration genetic algorithm (MPMGA) is not only suitable for simulation maps of various scales and various obstacle distributions, but also has superior performance and effectively solves the problems of the standard genetic algorithm.},

  abstract = {The Moon is the nearest celestial body to the Earth. Understanding the Moon is the most important issue confronting geosciences and planetary sciences. Japan will launch the lunar polar orbiter SELENE (Kaguya) (Kato et al., 2007) in 2007 as the first mission of the Japanese long-term lunar exploration program and acquire data for scientific knowledge and possible utilization of the Moon. An optical sensing instrument called the Lunar Imager/Spectrometer (LISM) is loaded on SELENE. The LISM requirements for the SELENE project are intended to provide high-resolution digital imagery and spectroscopic data for the entire lunar surface, acquiring these data for scientific knowledge and possible utilization of the Moon. Actually, LISM was designed to include three specialized sub-instruments: a terrain camera (TC), a multi-band imager (MI), and a spectral profiler (SP). The TC is a high-resolution stereo camera with 10-m spatial resolution from a SELENE nominal altitude of 100 km and a stereo angle of 30{$^\circ$} to provide stereo pairs from which digital terrain models (DTMs) with a height resolution of 20 m or better will be produced. The MI is a multi-spectral imager with four and five color bands with 20 m and 60 m spatial resolution in visible and near-infrared ranges, which will provide data to be used to distinguish the geological units in detail. The SP is a line spectral profiler with a 400-m-wide footprint and 300 spectral bands with 6--8 nm spectral resolution in the visible to near-infrared ranges. The SP data will be sufficiently powerful to identify the lunar surface's mineral composition. Moreover, LISM will provide data with a spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and covered spectral range superior to that of past Earth-based and spacecraft-based observations. In addition to the hardware instrumentation, we have studied operation plans for global data acquisition within the limited total data volume allotment per day. Results show that the TC and MI can achieve global observations within the restrictions by sharing the TC and MI observation periods, adopting appropriate data compression, and executing necessary SELENE orbital plane change operations to ensure global coverage by MI. Pre-launch operation planning has resulted in possible global TC high-contrast imagery, TC stereoscopic imagery, and MI 9-band imagery in one nominal mission period. The SP will also acquire spectral line profiling data for nearly the entire lunar surface. The east-west interval of the SP strip data will be 3--4 km at the equator by the end of the mission and shorter at higher latitudes. We have proposed execution of SELENE roll cant operations three times during the nominal mission period to execute calibration site observations, and have reached agreement on this matter with the SELENE project. We present LISM global surface mapping experiments for instrumentation and operation plans. The ground processing systems and the data release plan for LISM data are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) on the MESSENGER spacecraft will provide critical measurements tracing Mercury's origin and evolution. MDIS consists of a monochrome narrow-angle camera (NAC) and a multispectral wide-angle camera (WAC). The NAC is a 1.5{$^\circ$} field-of-view (FOV) off-axis reflector, coaligned with the WAC, a four-element refractor with a 10.5{$^\circ$} FOV and 12-color filter wheel. The focal plane electronics of each camera are identical and use a 1,024{\texttimes}1,024 Atmel (Thomson) TH7888A charge-coupled device detector. Only one camera operates at a time, allowing them to share a common set of control electronics. The NAC and the WAC are mounted on a pivoting platform that provides a 90{$^\circ$} field-of-regard, extending 40{$^\circ$} sunward and 50{$^\circ$} anti-sunward from the spacecraft +Z-axis---the boresight direction of most of MESSENGER's instruments. Onboard data compression provides capabilities for pixel binning, remapping of 12-bit data into 8 bits, and lossless or lossy compression. MDIS will acquire four main data sets at Mercury during three flybys and the two-Mercury-solar-day nominal mission: a monochrome global image mosaic at near-zero emission angles and moderate incidence angles, a stereo-complement map at off-nadir geometry and near-identical lighting, multicolor images at low incidence angles, and targeted high-resolution images of key surface features. These data will be used to construct a global image base map, a digital terrain model, global maps of color properties, and mosaics of high-resolution image strips. Analysis of these data will provide information on Mercury's impact history, tectonic processes, the composition and emplacement history of volcanic materials, and the thickness distribution and compositional variations of crustal materials. This paper summarizes MDIS's science objectives and technical design, including the common payload design of the MDIS data processing units, as well as detailed results from ground and early flight calibrations and plans for Mercury image products to be generated from MDIS data.},

Together with new evidence for recent ice-rich rock glaciers at the base of the Olympus Mons scarp superposed on larger Late Amazonian debris-covered piedmont glaciers, we interpret these deposits as evidence for geologically recent and recurring glacial activity in tropical and mid-latitude regions of Mars during periods of increased spin-axis obliquity when polar ice was mobilized and redeposited in microenvironments at lower latitudes. The data indicate that abundant residual ice probably remains in these deposits and that these records of geologically recent climate changes are accessible to future automated and human surface exploration.},

Then, the beach was traversed by a rocker-bogie-style rover equipped with a suite of sensors that are envisioned for use in future planetary rover missions. These sensors, configured so as to emulate the ExoMars rover, include stereo cameras, and time-of-flight and scanning light-detection-and-ranging sensors. This dataset will be of interest to researchers developing localization and mapping algorithms for vehicles traveling over natural and unstructured terrain in environments that do not have access to the global navigation satellite system, and where only previously taken satellite or aerial imagery is available.},

The majority of future Mars rovers would be solar-powered, which would require energy-optimal driving to maximize the range with limited energy. The essential and arguably the most challenging technology for realizing energy-optimal driving is the capability to predict the driving energy, which is needed to construct an energy-aware cost function for path planning. In this letter, we propose vision-based algorithms to remotely predict the driving energy consumption using machine learning. Specifically, we develop and compare two machine-learning models in this letter, namely VeeGer-EnergyNet andVeeger-TerramechanicsNet, respectively. The former is trained directly using recorded power, while the latter estimates terrain parameters from the images using a simplified-terramechanics model, and calculate the power based on the model. The two approaches are fully automated self-supervised learning algorithms. To combine RGB and depth images efficiently with high accuracy, we propose a new network architecture called Two-PNASNet-5, which is based on PNASNet-5.We collected a new dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Comparison of the two approaches showed thatVeeger-TerramechanicsNet had better performance than VeeGer-EnergyNet.}

This refers especially to 3D visualizations in the medical field, as well as, the industry domain, as valuable depth information can be related to the complex real-world structures and related data, which is also denoted as immersive analytics. However, the applicability of immersive analytics and its drawbacks, especially in the context of mixed reality, are quite unexplored. In order to validate the feasibility of immersive analytics for the aforementioned purposes, we designed and conducted a usability study with 60 participants. More specifically, we evaluated the effects of spatial sounds, performance changes from one analytics task to another, expert status, and compared an immersive analytics approach (i.e., a mixed-reality application) with a desktop-based solution. Participants had to solve several data analytics tasks (outlier's detection and cluster recognition) with the developed mixed-reality application. Thereby, the performance measures regarding time, errors, and movement patterns were evaluated. The separation into groups (low performer vs. high performer) was performed using a mental rotation pretest. When solving analytic tasks in mixed reality, participants changed their movement patterns in the mixed reality setting significantly, while the use of spatial sounds reduced the handling time significantly, but did not affect the movement patterns. Furthermore, the usage of mixed reality for cluster recognition is significantly faster than the desktop-based solution (i.e., a 2D approach). Moreover, the results obtained with self-developed questionnaires indicate 1) that wearing smart glasses are perceived as a potential stressor and 2) that the utilization of sounds is perceived very differently by the participants. Altogether, industry and researchers should consider immersive analytics as a suitable alternative compared to the traditional approaches.},

Potential scenarios include in-orbit applications to maximize mission life and to support long-term exploration missions with in situ manufacturing and recycling. However, its adoption is restricted by the availability of engineering polymers displaying mechanical performance combined with resistance to space conditions. Here, a thermotropic Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) is reported as a candidate material with extrusion 3D printing. To expand its scope of applicability to structural parts for space applications, four different exposure conditions are studied: thermal cycling under vacuum, atomic oxygen, UV, and electron irradiations. While 1 MeV-electron irradiation leads to a green coloration due to annealable color centers, the mechanical performance is only slightly decreased in dynamic mode. It is also found that increased printing temperature improves transverse strength and resistance to thermal cycling with the trade-off of tensile stiffness and strength. Samples exposed to thermal cycling and the highest irradiation dose at lower printing temperatures still display a Young's modulus of 30~GPa and 503~MPa of tensile strength which is exceptionally high for a 3D-printed polymer. For the types of exposure studied, overall, the results indicate that LCP 3D-printed parts are well suited for space applications.},

  abstract = {Water ice has been found in the permanently shadowed regions of impact craters around the lunar South Pole, which makes them ideal areas for in situ exploration missions. However, near the rim of impact craters, construction and exploration activities may cause slope instability. As a result, a better understanding of the shear strength of lunar soil under higher stress conditions is required. This paper mainly uses the finite element method to analyze slope stability to determine the position and shape of the slip surface and assess the safety factor. The height and gradient of the slope, the shear strength of lunar soil, and the lunar surface mission all influence the stability of the slope. We also analyze the soil mechanical properties of a soil slope adjacent to the traverse path of the Chang'E-4 Yutu-2 rover. Determining the stability of the slope at the lunar South Pole impact crater under various loading conditions will enhance the implementation of the lunar surface construction program. In this respect, this paper simulates a lunar mission landing at the Shackleton and Shoemaker craters and indicates that areas with higher cohesion lunar soil may be more stable for exploration in the more complex terrain of the South Pole.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Vertical holes of several tens of meters in diameter and depth have been discovered on the Moon, potentially serving as skylights into subsurface volcanic caverns resembling lava tubes. Because of their scientific importance and potential for use as future lunar bases, these lunar holes and caverns are expected to be targets of intensive exploration in the near future. Using numerical simulations, this study investigates the light environment within a directly and/or indirectly sunlit subsurface cavern accessed through a skylight hole. We specifically analyze the Mare Tranquillitatis Hole (MTH), one of the largest lunar vertical holes, situated near the Moon's nearside meridian. The floor and walls of the hole, and the walls and ceiling of its associated subsurface cavern are lit by reflected sunlight from other parts of the hole and cavern, such as the floors, depending on the solar elevation angle. Furthermore, this paper presents estimation results for camera imaging for a case in which solar elevation angle is 45{$^\circ$} in the morning, which is appropriate timing for exploration. Assuming reflectance of 0.1 for the lunar hole and cavern surfaces, we estimate the incident energy onto each pixel of a camera as it descends to the hole's floor. We specifically simulate conditions for a camera with a 12-bit dynamic range, similar to the wide-angle optical navigation camera (ONC-W) onboard the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft. The results suggest that a camera with a fixed gain would struggle to capture both directly and indirectly sunlit areas simultaneously, without saturating bright areas and ensuring minimum incident energy resolution (say, a 10 digital number) for darker areas. To overcome this challenge, adjusting the camera gain based on the hole's and cavern's illumination conditions is necessary.                            Graphical abstract},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper presents analytical models to investigate the steering maneuvers of planetary exploration rovers on loose soil. The models are based on wheel-soil interaction mechanics, or terramechanics, with which the traction and disturbance forces of a wheel are evaluated for various slip conditions. These traction forces are decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral directions of the wheel. The latter component, termed the side force has a major influence in characterizing the steering maneuvers of the rover. In this paper, the wheel-soil mechanics models are developed with particular attention to the side force and the validity of the model is confirmed by using a single-wheel test bed. The motion profile of the entire rover is numerically evaluated by incorporating the wheel-soil models into an articulated multibody model that describes the motion dynamics of the vehicle's body and chassis. Steering maneuvers are investigated under different steering angles by using a four-wheel rover test bed on simulated lunar soil regolith simulant. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results using the corresponding model parameters. The proposed wheel-and-vehicle model demonstrates better accuracy in predicting steering maneuvers as compared to the conventional kinematics-based model. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Fatigue refers to the progressive and localized structural damage that occurs when a material is subjected to repeated loading and unloading, typically at levels below its ultimate strength. Several failure mechanisms have been observed in practical scenarios, encompassing high-cycle, low-cycle, thermal, surface, corrosion, and fretting fatigue. Fatigue, connected to the failure of numerous engineered products, stands out as a prevalent cause of structural failure in service. Conducting research on the advancement and application of fatigue analysis technologies is crucial because fatigue analysis plays a critical role in determining the service life of components and mitigating the risk of failure. This study compiles data from a wide range of sources and offers a thorough summary of the state of fatigue analysis. It focuses on the effects of different parameters, including hardness, temperature, residual stresses, and hardfacing, on the fatigue life of different materials and their alloys. The fatigue life of alloys is typically high at low temperatures, but it is significantly reduced at high temperatures or under high-stress conditions. One of the main causes of lower fatigue life is residual stress. High-temperature conditions and hardfacing processes cause the development of tensile residual stresses, which in turn decreases fatigue life. But, if the hardness of the material significantly increases due to hardfacing, then the fatigue life also increases. This manuscript focuses on reviewing the research on fatigue-life prediction methods, shortcomings, and recommendations.},

The paper proposes a solution to the problem, considering different source and goal of each robot. Each robot uses a grammar based genetic programming for figuring the optimal path in a maze-like map, while a master evolutionary algorithm caters to the needs of overall path optimality. Co-operation amongst the individual robots' evolutionary algorithms ensures generation of overall optimal paths. The other feature of the algorithm includes local optimization using memory based lookup where optimal paths between various crosses in map are stored and regularly updated. Feature called wait for robot is used in place of conventionally used priority based techniques. Experiments are carried out with a number of maps, scenarios, and different robotic speeds. Experimental results confirm the usefulness of the algorithm in a variety of scenarios.},

There are 5 sections, each attributed to a certain AI-oriented area of space exploration, with most of the arguments being centred around data analysis. The first section inspects navigation in the booster (stage 1) landing systems in the Falcon 9 and its development with the help of an algorithm which has immense potential to be applied elsewhere. The second section spotlights the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation project or EMIT, acknowledging its cloud obstruction clause. The third section talks about an automated exoplanet detection algorithm and suggests improved instrumentation for better results. The fourth section is regarding the data calibration and classification pipeline in the James Webb Space Telescope and its highly advanced Morpheus model. The fifth section focuses on the autonomous mission operations in Martian rovers with special emphasis on the latest rovers- Curiosity \& Perseverance, focusing on improvements made in them.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = {We have used high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) of two rover landing sites based on mosaicked images from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera as a reference to evaluate DTMs based on High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and Context Camera (CTX) images. The Next-Generation Automatic Terrain Extraction (NGATE) matcher in the SOCET SET and GXP{\textregistered} commercial photogrammetric systems produces DTMs with good (small) horizontal resolution but large vertical error. Somewhat surprisingly, results for NGATE are terrain dependent, with poorer resolution and smaller errors on smoother surfaces. Multiple approaches to smoothing the NGATE DTMs give similar tradeoffs between resolution and error; a 5 {\texttimes} 5 lowpass filter is near optimal in terms of both combined resolution-error performance and local slope estimation. Smoothing with an area-based matcher, the standard processing for U.S. Geological Survey planetary DTMs, yields similar errors to the 5 {\texttimes} 5 filter at slightly worse resolution. DTMs from the HRSC team processing pipeline fall within this same trade space but are less sensitive to terrain roughness. DTMs produced with the Ames Stereo Pipeline also fall in this space at resolutions intermediate between NGATE and the team pipeline. Considered individually, resolution and error each varied by approximately a factor of 2. Matching errors were 0.2--0.5 pixels but most results fell in the 0.2--0.3 pixel range that has been stated as a rule of thumb in multiple prior studies. Horizontal resolutions of 10--20 image pixels were found, consistently greater than the 3--5 pixel spacing generally used for stereo DTM production. Resolution and precision were inversely correlated; their product varied by {$\leq$}20\% (4--5 pixels squared). Refinement of the stereo DTM by photoclinometry can yield quantitative improvement in resolution (more than a factor of 2), provided that albedo variations over distances smaller than the stereo DTM resolution are not too severe. We offer specific guidance for both producers and users of planetary stereo DTMs, based on our results.},

To prevent a rover from being stuck during its operation, one must understand the behavior of its wheel when it climbs over rigid obstacles in off-road environments. In this study, we apply an extended terramechanics model, which can reasonably describe the interaction between soft ground and vehicles, to analyze the obstacle-climbing behavior of rigid wheels. To describe the interaction between the wheel and a hard obstacle, we combine the penalty method with the extended terramechanics model. Subsequently, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its results with those of a traversing single wheel obtained from a laboratory experiment. Furthermore, we use the model to perform a multibody dynamics analysis on a simple rover, where its applicability to the examination of the overall performance of obstacle climbing is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an active analytical technique that makes use of a laser pulse to analyze materials of interest at a distance by creating a plasma, which emits photons at characteristic emission line wavelengths. We validate the technique for planetary exploration under vacuum conditions. We review the capability and advantages of the LIBS technique for lunar regolith analysis at 1.5 m distance from a lunar rover, and we characterize its potential for the detection of resources for future exploration, such as the determination of regolith water content. The limits of detection determined for the major elements (typically {$<$}1 wt \%) help to determine regolith parent material such as feldspathic highland rocks, rocks from the ancient magmatic high magnesian suite (Mg-suite), Fe-rich mare basalts or potassium, rare earth element, and phosphorus-rich (KREEP-rich) samples. Compositional parameters commonly used to classify lunar regoliths such as TiO 2, Al 2O 3, and K 2O abundances are readily determined by LIBS. Certain elements support regolith analysis: For example, Ba and Zr can be used to confirm KREEP-like composition, while quantifying the Ni and Co content can be used to infer the amount of meteoritic material. Finally, it is shown that the ice content of lunar soil produces strong H emissions with the LIBS techniques at the 25 wt \% H 2O level, while measurements on altered basalts give a limit of detection of about 1 wt \% for H 2O content. This demonstrates that the 5.6 wt \% water content detected by the recent LCROSS experiment should be easily detectable and quantifiable by LIBS analysis.

  abstract = {In this paper, we will present the combined efforts of Milrem Robotics and Tartu Observatory to transfer knowledge from industrial unmanned ground vehicles to Lunar rovers by subjecting the already develop ed terrestrial architecture to Lunar analogue environments and Lunar environment simulations. Large scale Moon and planetary surface exploration, and especially automatic in-situ resource utilization, require reliable mass produced rove rs that can be operated with minimal hum an intervention and allow for long maximally autonomous traverses and automatic integration of remote sensing with data gathered by the sensors onboard the rover. This task is already being solved for industrial robotics on Earth and in near future the numb er of terrestrial robots will be significantly higher than Lunar rovers, making it more beneficial to first develop the required technologies for terrestrial use and then to apply them with minimal modification for Lunar use. This approach contrasts to the regular way of developing rovers for space use only. For both use cases, operators would likely be still required, but for resolving problematic situations and higher level guidance or for precision control. The planned Lunar exploration architectures for Artemis program and the Lunar Gateway station would allow to command rovers from the Lunar orbit, giving operators near real-time tele-operation capabilities. This situation is similar to the unmanned vehicle approach being develop ed at Milrem Robotics, where the target is to provide semi-autonomous industrial robots that can automate tasks such as forestry, peat mining, agriculture, underground mine inspection and urban cleaning (11 robotic systems already developed, 10 in development, sold to various countries over the world). This would allow for a unified architecture for both cases, allowing to test and develop the required approaches in terrestrial industry and then to transfer the technologies and tools to Lunar rovers. Milrem Robotics and Tartu Observatory (part of University of Tartu, Estonia) are currently co-developing systems to increase industrial unmanned ground vehicle autonomy by fusing remote sensing data and sensors on the unmanned ground vehicles and both share the interest of transferring this knowledge also for Lunar rovers. We have also already tested the our UGV platform in scenarios comparable to lunar analog sites and are starting a collaboration with European Space Agency's European Space Operations Centre to co ordinate our efforts with European Lunar rover development roadmaps to develop a truly planetary autonomous vehicle architecture do allow both exploration and industrial utilization of both the Moon and Earth.}

  abstract = {Graphene-based composite materials are highly sought after for space applications due to their ability to encompass various properties, such as electrical conductivity, thermal resistance, and radiation shielding. This versatility allows for the creation of multifunctional components that can serve various purposes in space. Three-dimensional (3D) printing of composite materials in space offers a versatile and efficient means of manufacturing components, tools, and structures that are tailored to the unique challenges and requirements of space missions. In this work, we aim to develop 3D-printed composites made of medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) matrix and exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets (xGnP) as filler, using fused filament fabrication (FFF). Our research focuses on the challenges associated with the FFF process for fabricating MDPE/xGnP materials, particularly by optimizing filament extrusion and assessing the resulting material properties and space environmental compatibility. Firstly, we optimize the extrusion process, and use the MDPE/xGnP filaments to fabricate 3D-printed samples after defining the FFF parameters. We employ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to assess the melting properties and crystallization degree of the extruded filaments and 3D-printed samples, providing insights into the relationship between these properties and the characteristics of the initial powders. Electrical and tensile tests are carried out to evaluate the material properties after successfully mitigating challenges, such as warping and inadequate adhesion, to build plates during the printing process. Finally, we subject the 3D-printed composites to outgassing tests under exposure to the AM0 solar spectrum to evaluate their space environmental suitability. The results of this work demonstrate the capability of the FFF-based process to efficiently manufacture components made of MDPE/xGnP composites, providing optimized parameters for their potential in-space fabrication.},

By employing a digital line sampling technique and manual annotations as ground truth, GRAINet offers an innovative solution for particle size analysis. Eight UAV overflights were conducted between 2014 and 2022 to monitor changes in grain size dm across the river point bar. The resulting dm prediction maps showed reasonably accurate results, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values ranging from 1.9 cm to 4.4 cm in tenfold cross-validations. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values varied from 7.13 cm to 27.24 cm and 2.49 cm to 4.07 cm, respectively. Most models underestimated grain size, with around 68.5\% falling within 1{$\sigma$} and 90.75\% falling within 2{$\sigma$} of the predicted GRAINet mean dm. However, deviations from actual grain sizes were observed, particularly for grains smaller than 5 cm. The study highlights the importance of a large manually labeled training dataset for the GRAINet approach, eliminating the need for user-parameter tuning and improving its suitability for large-scale applications.},

Future missions, such as active debris removal for remediating the low Earth orbit environment, will rely on novel high-performance avionics to support advanced image processing algorithms with substantial workloads. However, when designing new avionics architectures, constraints relating to the use of electronics in space present great challenges, further exacerbated by the need for significantly faster processing compared to conventional space-grade central processing units. With the long-term goal of designing highperformance embedded computers for space, in this paper, an extended study and tradeoff analysis of a diverse set of computing platforms and architectures (i.e., central processing units, multicore digital signal processors, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays) are performed with radiation-hardened and commercial off-the-shelf technology. Overall, the study involves more than 30 devices and 10 benchmarks, which are selected after exploring the algorithms and specifications required for vision-based navigation. The present analysis combines literature survey and in-house development/testing to derive a sizable consistent picture of all possible solutions. Among others, the results show that certain 28 nm system-on-chip devices perform faster than space-grade and embedded central processing unitsby1-3 ordersofmagnitude, while consuming less than 10W. Field-programmable gate array platforms provide the highest performance per watt ratio.}

  abstract = {Increased mobile autonomy is a vital requisite for future planetary exploration rovers. Stereo vision is a key enabling technology in this regard, as it can passively reconstruct in three dimensions the surroundings of a rover and facilitate the selection of science targets and the planning of safe routes. Nonetheless, accurate dense stereo algorithms are computationally demanding.When executed on the low-performance, radiationhardened CPUs typically installed on rovers, slow stereo processing severely limits the driving speed and hence the science that can be conducted in situ. Aiming to decrease execution time while increasing the accuracy of stereo vision embedded in future rovers, this article proposes HW/SW co-design and acceleration on resource-constrained, space-grade FPGAs. In a top-down approach, we develop a stereo algorithm based on the space sweep paradigm, design its parallel HWarchitecture, implement it with VHDL, and demonstrate feasible solutions even on small-sized devices with our multi-FPGA partitioning methodology. To meet all cost, accuracy, and speed requirements set by the European Space Agency for this system, we customize our HW/SW co-processor by design space exploration and testing on a Mars-like dataset. Implemented on Xilinx Virtex technology, or European NG-MEDIUM devices, the FPGA kernel processes a 1,120 {\texttimes} 1,120 stereo pair in 1.7s-3.1s, utilizing only 5.4-9.3 LUT6 and 200-312 RAMB18. The proposed system exhibits up to 32{\texttimes} speedup over desktop CPUs, or 2,810{\texttimes} over space-grade LEON3, and achieves a mean reconstruction error less than 2cm up to 4m depth. Excluding errors exceeding 2cm (which are less than 4\% of the total), the mean error is under 8mm.}

  abstract = {Computer vision has traditionally focused on extracting structure, such as depth, from images acquired using thin-lens or pinhole optics. The development of computational imaging is broadening this scope; a variety of unconventional cameras do not directly capture a traditional image anymore, but instead require the joint reconstruction of structure and image information. For example, recent coded aperture designs have been optimized to facilitate the joint reconstruction of depth and intensity. The breadth of imaging designs requires new tools to understand the tradeoffs implied by different strategies. This paper introduces a unified framework for analyzing computational imaging approaches. Each sensor element is modeled as an inner product over the 4D light field. The imaging task is then posed as Bayesian inference: given the observed noisy light field projections and a prior on light field signals, estimate the original light field. Under common imaging conditions, we compare the performance of various camera designs using 2D light field simulations. This framework allows us to better understand the tradeoffs of each camera type and analyze their limitations. {\copyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.}

  abstract = {Introduction:\&\#160; The composition and provenance of the materials in South Pole - Aitken Basin (SPA) on southern farside is essential to a number of unresolved science questions relevant to lunar and solar system evolution. The Chang\&\#8217;E-4 mission is the first landed mission to this unexplored region, which provide a unique chance to further constrain the composition and provenance of the lunar interior [1].There is still controversy about the composition and provenance of materials in Chang 'e-4 landing site [1-7]. The first spectral interpretation results based on the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) indicate that the landing site is dominated by Low-Ca Pyroxene (LCP) and olivine, which may represent deep-seated materials potentially from the lunar mantle, delivered to the Chang\&\#8217;E-4 landing site by ejecta from the Finsen crater [1-3]. The Hapke model was also used to infer the minerals and glasses\&\#8217; abundances, which indicated that the landing site is dominated by plagioclase and lesser amount of mafic minerals [4-6]. Other study suggests that the composition of the landing site is still dominated by mare materials, which may be excavated and delivered by Zhinyu Crater [7].The Yutu-2 rover has been exploring on the lunar surface for more than 60 lunar days, lots of in-situ spectra have been obtained, we will use these in-situ spectral data, orbiting spectral data (M3) and Apollo lunar soils' spectral data in the laboratory to perform a detailed survey on the composition and provenance\&\#160; of materials on the Yutu-2 rover tranverse.Data and methods: Over 60 lunar days\&\#8217; data of the Visible and Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS) on the Yutu-2 lunar rover and the orbiting spectral data of the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3) are used. The VNIS data have been processed by dark current subtraction, flat field and instrument temperature correction, radiometric correction, reflectance calculation and spectral smoothing [1], etc. After deducting some data affected by terrain shadows and scattered light, a total of 131 spectral data of lunar soils were selected. For M3 data, the spectral data of some fresh impact craters in the ejecta area of Finsen impact crater and the inner area of Zhinyu impact crater are selected. The location and spectral curves of M3 data are shown in Figure 1. Besides, the spectral data of lunar soils (mare and highland) obtained by Relab are also used.Figure 1: The location of typical spectra of the selected M3 data. a) the spectral data locations of the fresh impact craters selected along the wall of Finsen impact crater (points A and B) and along the direction of ejecta (points C-G), H point located in side of Zhinyu impact crater. b) Typical spectral curves of the selected M3.Results and discussion:\&\#160; We firstly calculated the absorption bands of VNIS, M3 and Relab data at {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m and {\textasciitilde}2\&\#956;m, the results show that the absorption bands of VNIS at {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m and {\textasciitilde}2\&\#956;m are different from M3 and RELAB data (Figure 2). The absorption bands of VNIS at {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m are mainly concentrated in the range of 0.95{\textasciitilde}1.0\&\#956;m, while the absorption bands at {\textasciitilde}2\&\#956;m are mainly concentrated in the range of 1.95{\textasciitilde}2.1\&\#956;m. The absorption bands of VNIS at 2\&\#956;m is lower than that of the M3\&\#8217;s H point in the Zhiyu impact crater, and is closer or even shorter than that of M3\&\#8217;s A{\textasciitilde}G points in the Finsen impact ejecta. However, the absorption bands of VNIS at {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m is significantly higher than that of Finsen impact ejecta (A{\textasciitilde}G points) and Zhinyu impact crater (H points). The {\textasciitilde}2\&\#956;m absorption bands results indicate that the composition of the Chang 'e-4 landing site may be closer to the impact ejecta of Finsen crater, but the \&\#160;{\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m absorption bands results are different from that of the impact ejecta of Finsen crater. In order to further constrain the composition, the {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m asymmetry parameters are also calculated [8], and the results indicate that the Chang 'e-4 landing site may be rich in olivine or glass components (Figure 3).Figure2: Plot of the absorption bands of VNIS, M3 and Relab spectral data at {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m and {\textasciitilde}2\&\#956;m. a) The black data points are VNIS spectral data, and the color data points are M3 spectral data selected in the ejecta direction of Finsen impact crater and Bajie / Zhinyu impact crater.Figure 3: Plot of the {\textasciitilde}1\&\#956;m asymmetry of VNIS.

  abstract = {Background In recent years, we have seen renewed efforts to study and explore the Moon; modern techniques like machine learning can be important in this context, especially in recognising and classifying the lunar surface. The EXPLORE Machine Learning Lunar Data Challenge was a public initiative during the last quarter of 2022. Its objective was to encourage participants to apply machine learning techniques to identify potential hazards for a planetary mission and to design a robotic traverse for exploring the lunar surface. Methods The lunar region targeted by the challenge was the Archytas Dome in Mare Frigoris, a location with a varied geology and a potential zone for future exploration. We provided training datasets of craters and boulders to the participants, who used them to complete the three steps of the challenge: creating a model that detects these landforms, applying these models to the Archytas Dome region, and computing a traverse for optimal exploration of the zone. In this paper, we showcase the results and considerations of the team that won the challenge. The first step was to enhance the training data by generating new labels and resizing the existing ones. The original and the improved dataset were then used to train four iterations of a neural network model. Results The model with the enhanced dataset yielded the best scores when applied to the Archytas Domes zone (75.46{\textbackslash}\%). Finally, the traverse was calculated using proximity analysis while avoiding steep slopes and dangerous landforms. Conclusions We found that the variations between tasks and the different approaches necessary to solve them turned out to be the major difficulty of the challenge, as it required backgrounds in both remote sensing and computer sciences. This was reflected in the low participation and the multidisciplinary of the members of the winning team.},

A modular platform allows for accommodating different payloads and allocating them in the most advantageous positions for the mission they are going to undertake (for example, having direct access to the lunar surface for the payloads that require it), while also allowing for the relocation of payloads and reconfiguring the rover design itself to perform completely different tasks.},

These missions include: the Polar Explorer (PE), In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and Astrophysics Lunar Observatory (ALO) and Lunar Geological Exploration Mission (LGEM). Therefore, designing a multipurpose rover that can serve these missions is crucial. The rover needs to be compatible with three different mission scenarios, each with an independent payload, making flexibility the key driver. This study focuses on modularity in the rover's locomotion solution and autonomous on-board system. Moreover, the proposed EMRS solution has been tested at an analogue facility to prove the modular mobility concept. The tests involved the rover's mobility in a lunar soil simulant testbed and different locomotion modes in a rocky and uneven terrain, as well as robustness against obstacles and excavation of lunar regolith. As a result, the EMRS project has developed a multipurpose modular rover concept, with power, thermal control, insulation, and dust protection systems designed for further phases. This paper highlights the potential of the EMRS system for lunar exploration and the importance of modularity in rover design.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Condensed volatiles within lunar permanently shadowed regions are of high scientific and resource utilization importance. Volatiles remain elusive and difficult to observe directly, due to low direct solar illumination. In this work, we investigate correlations between, as well as possible effects of, condensed volatiles and surface roughness. We analyze topographic roughness at 50 m and 30--120 m baselines of the lunar south pole (poleward of 85{$^\circ$} S). We focus on six south polar craters of interest and their directly surrounding non-cold-trap areas: Faustini, Shoemaker, Haworth, Cabeus, Nobile, and an unnamed region. We further analyze six analogous equatorial craters to investigate the non-ice smoothing contributions: Morozov F, Rosenberger C, Van Maanen, Fraunhofer E, Brisbane, and Asclepi. Lastly, we compare a sunlit and a permanently shaded portion of the Amundsen crater floor. Utilizing data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, and Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we find subdued roughness within cold traps but determine that roughness is not a unique identifier of condensed volatiles. However, a correlation between LOLA roughness, LAMP normalized Off-band/On-band albedo, temperature, and water-ice stability suggests possible terrain softening due to condensed volatiles, although we cannot rule out dust ponding and/or fairy castle structure contributions. We conclude that LAMP volatile signatures at the topmost {$\sim$}100 nm may be indicative of volatile deposits at depths beyond the LAMP sensing capabilities.},

CTX will (1) provide context images for data acquired by other MRO instruments, (2) observe features of interest to NASA's Mars Exploration Program (e.g., candidate landing sites), and (3) conduct a scientific investigation, led by the MARCI team, of geologic, geomorphic, and meteorological processes on Mars. CTX consists of a digital electronics assembly; a 350 mm f/3.25 Schmidt-type telescope of catadioptric optical design with a 5.7{$^\circ$} field of view, providing a {$\sim$}30-km-wide swath from {$\sim$}290 km altitude; and a 5000-element CCD with a band pass of 500--700 nm and 7               {$\mu$}               m pixels, giving {$\sim$}6 m/pixel spatial resolution from MRO's nearly circular, nearly polar mapping orbit. Raw data are transferred to the MRO spacecraft flight computer for processing (e.g., data compression) before transmission to Earth. The ground data system and operations are based on 9 years of Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera on-orbit experience. CTX has been allocated 12\% of the total MRO data return, or about {$\geq$}3 terabits for the nominal mission. This data volume would cover {$\sim$}9\% of Mars at 6 m/pixel, but overlapping images (for stereo, mosaics, and observation of changes and meteorological events) will reduce this area. CTX acquired its first (instrument checkout) images of Mars on 24 March 2006.},

The levels of degradation observed in the impact craters were determined alongside the surface features. Subsequently, the degradation patterns of the impact craters located within the Yutu-2's roving area and the distribution patterns of the morphological parameters were analysed and investigated. The results of the analysis indicate that 94\% of the impact craters exhibited severe degradation, 80\% had depth-to-diameter ratios (DDRs) ranging from 0.07 to 0.17, and the remaining craters were moderately degraded. The DDRs of the impact craters exhibited a declining trend with an increase in the dimensions of the impact craters. Additionally, the degree of degradation of impact crater populations demonstrated a decreasing trend. In general, the impact craters along the rover's route exhibited severe degradation, with the population of degradation degrees gradually decreasing with increasing diameter.},

As part of the Perseverance payload, SuperCam is a suite of five techniques that provide critical and complementary observations via Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), Time-Resolved Raman and Luminescence (TRR/L), visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VISIR), high-resolution color imaging (RMI), and acoustic recording (MIC). SuperCam operates at remote distances, primarily 2--7~m, while providing data at sub-mm to mm scales. We report on SuperCam's science objectives in the context of the Mars 2020 mission goals and ways the different techniques can address these questions. The instrument is made up of three separate subsystems: the Mast Unit is designed and built in France; the Body Unit is provided by the United States; the calibration target holder is contributed by Spain, and the targets themselves by the entire science team. This publication focuses on the design, development, and tests of the Mast Unit; companion papers describe the other units. The goal of this work is to provide an understanding of the technical choices made, the constraints that were imposed, and ultimately the validated performance of the flight model as it leaves Earth, and it will serve as the foundation for Mars operations and future processing of the data.}

These benefits include improved crew egress/ingress and large-cargo unloading; excellent surface visibility during landing; elimination of the need for deep-throttling descent engines; potentially reduced plume-surface interactions and lower vertical touchdown velocity; and reduced lander gross mass through efficient mass staging and volume segmentation.

Component geometry and tailored maintenance procedures are used to achieve high endurance. Endurance tests based on walking data predict that the ropes will survive roughly 247, 000 cycles when used on large (90kg), fully actuated bipedal robot systems. The drive systems have been incorporated into two novel bipedal robots capable of 3D unsupported walking. Robot data illustrates effective torque tracking and nearly silent operation. Finally, comparisons with alternative transmission designs illustrate the size, weight, and endurance advantages of using this type of synthetic rope drive system.},

  abstract = {The HiRISE camera features a 0.5 m diameter primary mirror, 12 m effective focal length, and a focal plane system that can acquire images containing up to 28 Gb (gigabits) of data in as little as 6 seconds. HiRISE will provide detailed images (0.25 to 1.3 m/pixel) covering {$\sim$}1\% of the Martian surface during the 2-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) beginning November 2006. Most images will include color data covering 20\% of the potential field of view. A top priority is to acquire {$\sim$}1000 stereo pairs and apply precision geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning, conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines. HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites, and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry, glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith properties. An Internet Web site (HiWeb) will enable anyone in the world to suggest HiRISE targets on Mars and to easily locate, view, and download HiRISE data products.},

  abstract = {To enable the design of planning and control strategies in simulated environments before their direct application to the real robot, exploiting the Sim2Real practice, powerful and realistic dynamic simulation tools have been proposed, e.g., the ROS-Gazebo framework. However, the majority of such simulators do not account for some of the properties of recently developed advanced systems, e.g., dynamic elastic behaviors shown by all those robots that purposely incorporate compliant elements into their actuators, the so-called Articulated Soft Robots ASRs. This paper presents an open-source ROS-Gazebo toolbox for simulating ASRs equipped with the aforementioned types of compliant actuators. To achieve this result, the toolbox consists of two ROS-Gazebo modules: a plugin that implements the custom compliant characteristics of a given actuator and simulates the internal motor dynamics, and a Robotic Operation System (ROS) manager node used to organize and simplify the overall toolbox usage. The toolbox can implement different compliant joint structures to perform realistic and representative simulations of ASRs, also when they interact with the environment. The simulated ASRs can be also used to retrieve information about the physical behavior of the real system from its simulation, and to develop control policies that can be transferred back to the real world, leveraging the Sim2Real practice. To assess the versatility of the proposed plugin, we report simulations of different compliant actuators. Then, to show the reliability of the simulated results, we present experiments executed on two ASRs and compare the performance of the real hardware with the simulations. Finally, to validate the toolbox effectiveness for Sim2Real control design, we learn a control policy in simulation, then feed it to the real system in feedforward comparing the results.},

Past images of the surface of Phobos show that it is covered by a layer of regolith. However, the mechanical and compositional properties of this regolith are poorly constrained. In particular, from current remote images, very little is known regarding the particle sizes, their chemical composition, the packing density of the regolith as well as other parameters such as friction and cohesion that influence surface dynamics. Understanding the properties and dynamics of the regolith in the low-gravity environment of Phobos is important to trace back its history and surface evolution. Moreover, this information is also important to support the interpretation of data obtained by instruments onboard the main MMX spacecraft, and to minimize the risks involved in the spacecraft sampling operations. The instruments onboard the Rover are a Raman spectrometer (RAX), an infrared radiometer (miniRad), two forward-looking cameras for navigation and science purposes (NavCams), and two cameras observing the interactions of regolith and the rover wheels (WheelCams). The Rover will be deployed before the MMX spacecraft samples Phobos' surface and will be the first rover to drive on the surface of a Martian moon and in a very low gravity environment.

In the standoff Raman mode the system is capable of measuring various minerals, water, ices, and atmospheric gases from a 50 meter range with a 10 s integration time. At shorter distances of 10 m or less, good quality Raman spectra can be obtained within 1 s. The time-gated system is capable of detecting both the target mineral as well as the atmospheric gases before the target using their Raman fingerprints. Various materials can easily be identified through glass, plastic, and water media. The time-gating capability makes the system insensitive to window material, which is highly desirable for future missions to Venus where instruments are expected to be within the lander. The standoff LIBS range is 10 m and LIBS spectra of various minerals can be obtained with single laser pulse excitation. The standoff LIBS capability provides additional elemental verification of the targeted material. {\copyright} 2011 SPIE.}

  abstract = {A coupling is mechanical device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmission of power. The basic role of couplings is to join two parts of rotating elements while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. Presently Oldham's coupling and Universal joints are used for parallel offset power transmission and angular offset transmission. These joints have limitations on maximum offset distance, angle, speed and result in vibrations, noise and low efficiency (below 70\%). These limitations can be overcome with Thompson constant velocity (CV) coupling which offers features like minimizing side loads, higher misalignment capabilities, more operating speeds, improved efficiency of transmission and many more. The constant velocity joint is an alteration in design that offers up to 18 mm parallel offset and 21-degree angular offset, at high speeds up to 2000 or 2500 rpm at 90\% efficiency. This design lowers cost of production, space requirement and simply technology of manufacture as compared too present CVJ in market. This paper presents review on constant velocity joints/couplings design and optimization.},

  abstract = {Introduction Large area, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) mapping of a planetary surface is not only essential for performing key science investigations on the formation and evolution of the surface, but is also critical for planning and supporting existing and future surface robotic missions as well as planning human exploration. Over the past 20 years, 3D mapping of the Moon surface has only been performed for larger areas with low-resolution data, or for very small areas with higher-resolution data.\&\#160;Large area lower-resolution 3D mapping work usually refers to the global lunar digital terrain models (DTMs) created from the NASA Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and LOLA altitudes blended with the Japanese SELenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) DTMs from the Kaguya Team at a grid-spacing at 118 m/pixel and 60 m/pixel, respectively, or using the Chang\&\#8217;E-2 3D image products at 7mpp or 3D map products at 20mpp. On the other hand, smaller area higher-resolution 3D mapping work usually employs the LROC Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images at 0.5-1.5 m/pixel producing DTMs at about 5m/pixel using photogrammetry or DTMs at 0.5-1.5 m/pixel using photoclinometry.The limitations of having to trade-off between \&\#8220;large area\&\#8221; and \&\#8220;high-resolution\&\#8221;, for lunar 3D mapping is a consequence of three different aspects. Firstly, lower-resolution data such as LROC WAC and Chang\&\#8217;E-2 (CE-2) generally have better stereo coverage, whereas the main high-resolution data to date (LROC NAC) only has limited stereo coverage (\&\#8804;1\% of the lunar surface). Secondly, the photogrammetry and photoclinometry processes are complex and subject to different errors (or artefacts) at each of their different processing stages, which require specialist expertise to deal with these complexities in order to produce high-quality DTM products, especially over large areas. Thirdly, the expensive computational cost from existing photogrammetry and photoclinometry pipelines makes it extremely difficult to achieve large area high-resolution coverage in any realistic time-scale.\&\#160;To address these limitations, a single input image-based rapid surface modelling system has been developed, called MADNet 2.0 (Multi-scale generative Adversarial U-net with Dense convolutional and up-projection blocks) [1] to create high-resolution DTM products for the NASA MoonTrek system previously for the von Karman crater [2]. Here we apply MADNet to 7 of the 13 ARTEMIS landing sites near the lunar south pole which have very different illumination conditions.\&\#160;Methods 27 higher resolution LOLA DTMs of 5 mpp (usually they are 118 mpp) were processed by the NASA GSFC LOLA team [1] and are shown in Figure 1.\&\#160;Figure 1. Display of 5 m/pixel LOLA DTMs created by the NASA GSFC LOLA team against a background generated from the LOLA 118 m/pixel global DTM. Our focus here is on the generation of 1m MADNet DTMs covering areas marked as Haworth, 23, 20, 6, DM1, DM2 and 7. Figure taken from https://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/78A description of the overall MADNet processing chain can be found in [1] and Figure 2.\&\#160;Figure 2. Flowchart of the MADNet 2.0 processing chain for DTM retrieval of single LROC-NAC imagesA key requirement is the training of the network using pre-existing photogrammetrically derived DTMs consisting of 22,084 ORI-DTM training pairs (512*512 pixels at 5 m/pixel) which were formed using 392 pairs of single-strip downsampled 5 m/pixel LROC NAC PDS ORIs and 5 m/pixel stereo DTMs with horizontal and vertical flipping. The LROC NAC DTM processing includes 1) initial input selection (247 single-strip EDR data downloaded) and screening (103 out of 247 selected) for non-overlapping, quality and shadow control; 2) USGS-ISIS based pre-processing for format conversion (from PDS to ISIS CUBE), geometric calibration, artefact/noise removal and SPICE kernel initialisation, USGS-ISIS map-projection and orthorectification (cam2map) w.r.t. LOLA; 3) LROC NAC image co-alignment using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP)\&\#8217;s image\_align method; 4) Manual tie-point based LROC NAC image co-registration with 5 m/pixel LOLA DTM; 5) MADNet based image-to-DTM inference that follows the standard MADNet 2.0 processing chain that is described in [1,2]; 6) ASP based tile and DTM mosaicing, as well as LROC NAC image orthorectification.\&\#160;Results Seven 20 x 20 sq.km areas were processed but where there were significant gaps due to permanent shadows, these had to be filled in using the 5 mpp LOLA DTMs. Neither the NASA Shadowcam instrument [4] nor the Chandraya\&\#8217;an-2 OHRC [5] have sufficient coverage at present. Only 2 of the 7 sites show coverage {$>$} 50\% as shown in Table 1.\&\#160;Table 1. Summary of the higher-resolution LROC NAC DTM pixel coverage for the LOLA filled LROC NAC DTM mosaics of each site.

Significantly more detail is shown in the 1mpp DTMs compared with the LOLA 5 mpp DTMs. In order to fill these gaps in future, there need to be sufficient Shadowcam and/or Chandraya\&\#8217;an-2 OHRC shadow images and corresponding stereo DTMs at lower resolution for updating the training of the MADNet prediction model.

Bush's plan has once again enlivened the long-lasting discussion of manned spaceflight vs. robotic exploration. Also, the plan to use the moon as a stepping stone has come under scrutiny and is being debated. Alternate approaches minimizing or deleting manned lunar exploration in the frame of the VSE were proposed. In order to assess the value of us going back to the moon, it is necessary to debate without bias the meaning of human spaceflight in general and to discuss the role of science in future efforts.},

Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all SLAM tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing. A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets. ORB-SLAM achieves unprecedented performance with respect to other state-of-the-art monocular SLAM approaches.

  abstract = {Abstract          IDEFIX, the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission Phobos rover, will be the first of its kind to attempt wheeled-locomotion on a low-gravity surface. The IDEFIX WheelCams, two cameras placed on the underside of the rover looking at the rover wheels, provide a unique opportunity to study the surface properties of Phobos, regolith behaviour on small-bodies and rover mobility in low-gravity. The information gained about Phobos' surface will be of high importance to the landing and sampling operations of the main MMX spacecraft, in addition to being valuable for understanding the surface processes and geological history of Phobos. Here we introduce the WheelCam science objectives, the instrument and the characterisation activities. We also discuss the on-going preparations linked to the analysis and interpretation of the WheelCam images on the surface of Phobos.},

It becomes difficult to understand the tribological behaviour of mating bodies under the extreme environmental circumstances in space due to their potential chemical and physical interactions. The radiation, vacuum, environmental conditions and temperature, are the factors which affects the friction and wear behaviour of mating surfaces and may alter the chemical structure of solid or liquid lubricant. The combination of tribo-physical and tribo-chemical interactions makes the tribological analysis very difficult to understand. The lack of understanding and ignorance might be the reason for not addressing this issue in the past. This review contains the qualitative and quantitative information on the tribological behaviour of different types of liquid lubricants, greases, soft and hard coatings, combined lubrication systems, testing equipment, composites, solid lubricants and alloys developed for space applications.},

  abstract = {Relatively recent discoveries have shown that large quantities of water can be found on moons of some of the planets among the gas giants in our solar system. Robotic mobility systems can study the varied geology and origins of these bodies if they are able to navigate the complex terrains of ocean worlds. The topographical features of ocean worlds present a unique combination of challenges for mobility. These include cryogenic ice, penitentes, salt evaporites, chaotic regions, and regolith with uncertain shear and sinkage properties. Uncertainty in both terrain properties and geometry motivates design of a platform that is mobile within a large range of obstacle geometries and terrain properties. This article reports on a research effort to study the requirements and numerically optimize the kinematic parameters of the rover to satisfy these goals. The platforms selected in the process were further verified via simulation. A simulation and analysis of grousers generated suitable designs for interaction with similar ledges and rough terrain. From this analysis, a prototype was developed and tested to meet the wide range of topography and terramechanics conditions expected on these bodies.},

Checking the fatigue life, first of all, is carried out separately for components, electronic and mechanical systems of the car by the bench test method, and the next step is to check the fatigue life of the car assembled by the road test method. The most urgent task is to check the strength and durability of the car chassis in the early stages of design. Currently, the mandatory and classic approach of all leading automakers when designing a car at the stage of a technical project is to apply the methodology for checking the vehicle's steering suspension device and its power structure on multi-channel stands, and the hub assembly verification methodology is separately applied. [1] This paper describes the basic principles of the hub assembly methodology checking to be applied to any motor vehicle. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the versatility of the developed methodology for assessing the strength and durability of suspension elements. Substantiated adaptation (adjustment) of the forced load cycle of a passenger car of class M1, M2 is offered to an unmanned vehicle.},

  abstract = {The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), originally developed for the Russian-led Mars-96 mission, was selected as part of the Orbiter payload for ESA's Mars Express mission. The HRSC is a pushbroom scanning instrument with nine CCD line detectors mounted in parallel in the focal plane. Its unique feature is the ability to obtain near-simultaneous imaging data of a specific site at high resolution, with along-track triple stereo, four colours and five different phase angles, thus avoiding any time-dependent variations of the observational conditions. An additional Super-Resolution Channel (SRC) - a framing device - will yield nested images in the metre-resolution range for detailed photogeologic studies. The spatial resolution from the nominal periapsis altitude of 250 km will be 10 m px-1, with an image swath of 53 km, for the HRSC and 2.3 m px-1 for the SRC. During the mission's nominal operational lifetime of 1 martian year (2 Earth years) and assuming an average HRSC data transfer share of 40\%, it will be possible to cover at least 50\% of the martian surface at a spatial resolution of {$\leq$}15 m px-1. More than 70\% of the surface can be observed at a spatial resolution of {$\leq$}30 m px-1, while more than 1\% will be imaged at better than 2.5 m px-1. The HRSC will thus close the gap between the medium- to low-resolution coverage and the very high-resolution images of the Mars Observer Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor mission and the in situ observations and measurements by landers. The HRSC will make a major contribution to the study of martian geosciences, with special emphasis on the evolution of the surface in general, the evolution of volcanism, and the role of water throughout martian history. The instrument will obtain images containing morphologic and topographic information at high spatial and vertical resolution, allowing the improvement of the cartographic base down to scales of 1:50000. The experiment will also address atmospheric phenomena and atmosphere-surface interactions, and will provide urgently needed support for current and furture lander missions as well as for exobiological studies. The goals of HRSC on Mars Express will not be met by any other planned mission or instrument.},

Here we show that calderas on five major volcanoes on Mars have undergone repeated activation and resurfacing during the last 20 per cent of martian history, with phases of activity as young as two million years, suggesting that the volcanoes are potentially still active today. Glacial deposits at the base of the Olympus Mons escarpment show evidence for repeated phases of activity as recently as about four million years ago. Morphological evidence is found that snow and ice deposition on the Olympus construct at elevations of more than 7,000\,metres led to episodes of glacial activity at this height. Even now, water ice protected by an insulating layer of dust may be present at high altitudes on Olympus Mons.},

ERGO is aimed to future space missions, in which space robots will require a higher level of autonomy (e.g. Exomars or Mars2020). As a framework, ERGO provides a set of components that can be reused and tailored for robots space missions (Orbital, Deep Space or Planetary Explorations) in which the on-board system has to work autonomously, performing complex operations in hazardous environments without human intervention. The concept of autonomy can be applied to a whole set of operations to be performed on-board with no human supervision, such as Martian exploration rovers, deep space probes, or in-orbit assembly robots. In the last decades, the advantages of increasing the level of autonomy in spacecraft have been demonstrated in planetary rovers. At the same time, orbital space missions have already successfully applied autonomy concepts on board, in particular for autonomous event detection and on-board activities planning. ERGO provides a framework for on-board autonomy systems based on a specific paradigm aimed to facilitate an easy integration and/or expansion covering future mission needs; by using this paradigm, both reactive and deliberative capabilities can be orchestrated on-board. In ERGO, deliberative capabilities are provided via AI techniques: automated planning and machine-learning based vision systems. ERGO also provides a set of tools for developing safety-critical space mission applications and FDIR systems. Moreover, specific components for motion planning, path planning, hazard avoidance and trajectory control are also part of the framework. Finally, ERGO is integrated with the TASTE middleware. All ERGO components are now being tested in an orbital and a planetary scenario. This paper discusses the ERGO components, its main characteristics, and how they have been applied to an orbital and a planetary scenario. It provides an overview of the evolution of the ERGO system; its main components and the tests that have been performed so far.}

Water, other volatiles, and lunar materials such as regolith, metals, or rare-earth elements are potential resources that can support the sustainable human and robotic exploration of the Moon and the Solar System beyond. Previous Mars and Moon rover missions have highlighted a limitation in mobility, with surface rovers traversing only a few tens of meters per day, except for the manned Apollo rovers. This limitation can be primarily attributed to the rover locomotion system and its power storage capabilities from one side, and the other by the lack/reduced skills in terms of autonomous capability to take decisions on-board. To address this issue, RAPID, an ESA project led by GMV, aims at developing a semi-autonomous rover capable of safely traversing lunar areas at high speeds ({$>$} 1 m/s), using a visual navigation based GNC system and passive suspension targeted for high-speed mobility. This paper discusses the development of this autonomous rover, its different subsystems and the results obtained during the field tests.}

The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85\% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50\%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.},

It combines stereophotogrammetry and photoclinometry to produce a product that has the accuracy of stereo with the resolution of photoclinometry without the restrictions common to both. We describe the implementation of this technique in the context of digital terrain model (DTM) generation for a small-body mission. We detail the process and the data used to generate SPC-derived DTMs at progressively increasing resolutions. The highest-quality DTMs are generated using four images optimized for topography, a 30{$^\circ$} emission angle with the emission azimuth (spacecraft position) to the north, east, south, and west of the target, and one image optimized for albedo (a low incidence angle such that most of the image pixels' digital numbers are based upon albedo rather than topography). We discuss implications for mission planning and how SPC-based DTM generation can support spacecraft navigation. As a case study, we share outcomes from the modeling performed for the OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid Bennu.},

  abstract = {Planetary rovers, such as those currently on Mars, face difficult path planning problems, both before landing during the mission planning stages as well as once on the ground. In this work, we present a new approach to these planning problems based on inverse reinforcement learning using deep convolutional networks and value iteration networks (VIN) as important internal structures. VIN are an approximation of the value iteration (VI) algorithm implemented with convolutional neural networks to make VI fully differentiable. We propose a modification to the value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the VIN. It relies on an internal soft policy model, where the policy is represented with a probability distribution over all possible actions, rather than a deterministic policy that returns only the best action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in both a grid world dataset as well as a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated from currently deployed rover mission planning tools and real Mars imagery.}

  abstract = {Autonomous lunar exploration is a complex task that requires the development of sophisticated algorithms to control the movement of lunar rovers in a challenging environment, based on visual feedback. To train and evaluate these algorithms, it is crucial to have access to both a simulation framework and data that accurately represent the conditions on the lunar surface, with the main focus on providing the visual fidelity necessary for computer vision algorithm development. In this paper, we present a lunar-orientated robotic simulation environment, developed using the Unity game engine, built on top of robot operating system 2 (ROS 2), which enables researchers to generate quality synthetic vision data and test their algorithms for autonomous perception and navigation of lunar rovers in a controlled environment. To demonstrate the versatility of the simulator, we present several use cases in which it is deployed on various efficient hardware platforms, including FPGA and Edge AI devices, to evaluate the performance of different vision-based algorithms for lunar exploration. In general, the simulation environment provides a valuable tool for researchers developing lunar rover systems.},

While CAN has similar performances to both the OBDH bus and to MIL-STD-1553B, it is an attractive option for several reasons, including: {$\cdot$} Very low cost; {$\cdot$} High reliability; {$\cdot$} Readily available commercial hardware for terrestrial applications; {$\cdot$} Readily available commercial components and VHDL cores; {$\cdot$} Very widely deployed in terrestrial applications; {$\cdot$} Underlying physical layers with high reliability and high availability characteristics; {$\cdot$} Many well established and emerging higher layer protocols for use over CAN bus; However, the CAN bus is significantly different in several respects from the buses that have traditionally been used onboard spacecraft. Most notably, CAN does not operate in a master/slave mode. Instead, control of the bus, and in particular bus medium access, is distributed amongst all nodes connected to the bus. Two other important differences are that the CAN bus is inherently asynchronous in nature, and uses frame labelling rather than node addressing. The goal of this paper is to highlight the work that is currently being carried out by the ESTEC CAN Bus Working Group, which is trying to ease the implementation of the CAN bus by establishing recommendations and guidelines for its use in spacecraft applications. The paper also provides an introduction to the CAN bus and its associated physical layer and higher layer protocols.},

Improving our knowledge about the formation and evolution of the Moon helps us 1) to understand the geology of Earth and other terrestrial bodies in the Solar System, and 2) to prepare for in-situ utilisation of lunar resources. Irregular mare patches (IMPs), as well as lava tubes, pits and caves are such lunar geological phenomena that offer progress with both tasks. Even though multiple IMPs were found on the surface of the Moon, their age and formation processes remain enigmatic. Furthermore, many pits have been detected in various lunar geological settings, but it remains uncertain whether any of these openings could lead to extended cave conduits underground. The proposed Lunar Geology Orbiter LUGO aims primarily to reveal the formation ages and mechanisms of IMPs, and secondarily to identify the distribution and dimensions of lava tubes for future exploration.WHY IRREGULAR MARE PATCHES?Controversy surrounds the formation age of IMPs because very few impact craters are present at their surface.

  abstract = {IntroductionThe Chang\&\#8217;e-5 (CE-5) mission is China\&\#8217;s first lunar sample return mission. CE-5 landed at Northern Oceanus Procellarum (43.06\&\#176;N, 51.92\&\#176;W) on December 1, 2020, collected 1731 g of lunar samples, and returned to the Earth on December 17, 2020. The CE-5 landing site is {\textasciitilde}170 km ENE of Mons R\&\#252;mker, on one of the youngest mare basalts (Em4/P58) of the Moon [1,2], which are never sampled by the Apollo or Luna missions. The CE-5 returned samples are currently being analyzed by the Chinese scientists, and the first batch of data have been released by the Lunar Sample Information Database (https://moon.bao.ac.cn/moonSampleMode/index.html). This study describes the provenance of lunar regolith at the CE-5 landing site in order to provide context for the ongoing sample analysis.Exotic Material Source CratersBecause Em4/P58, where CE-5 landed, has a late-Eratosthenian age [1], all pre-Eratosthenian craters and most Eratosthenian craters nearby are not ejecta source craters. Calling on the initial selection of ejecta source craters by [3] and the local geological backgrounds [4], we proposed Aristarchus, Copernicus, Harding, Harpalus, Kepler, Lichtenberg, Pythagoras, and Sharp B are potential main ejecta source craters. R\&\#252;mker E is also taken into account because its ray/ejecta is easily distinguished from the mare basalts to the southeast of Mons R\&\#252;mker.To determine post-Em4/P58 craters, we conducted a comprehensive literature study of these nine craters to collect their AMAs or relative ages (Table1 in [5]). Aristarchus (280 Ma), Copernicus (779-796 Ma), Harding (881 Ma), and Kepler (625-950 Ma) are Copernican-aged and dramatically younger than \&\#8764;1.53Ga, and their ejecta inevitably overlies the Em4/P58. Lichtenberg ({$>$}1.68G) and Pythagoras (2.68 Ga) are older than 1.53 Ga, therefore, they are unlikely to be ejecta source craters. To the east of Em4/P58, albedo and compositional data show abundant ejecta with a NE-SW direction; thus, we inferred that the NE-SW orientated ejecta should dominate the ejecta composition because of their extensive areal distribution. Ejecta tracing back to the parent craters indicate an origin either from Harpalus or Sharp B or both. More detailed morphological and compositional investigations of Harpalus and Sharp B craters show that Harpalus has a much younger appearance, with distinct high albedo radial ray/ejecta and boulders. Sharp B crater has a more subdued morphology, without clear radial ejecta and boulders. Based on their morphology and degradation state, Harpalus is likely to be Copernican-aged and Sharp B should be Eratosthenian-aged or even older, while crater counting directly on their rims are NOT reliable [5], which may be contaminated by secondary craters, self-secondary craters, partially buried craters, and the extra slopes.After we examined the main source craters of ejecta in the mapped region, we conducted a thorough investigation of ejecta in Em4/P58 using their long axis directions (Fig. 1); the ejecta was traced back to one of the nine listed craters. According to the mapping, the eastern part of Em4/P58 is covered by extensive ejecta from Harpalus crater, which can be traced continuously back to its source. Three large Copernican craters to the southeast of Em4/P58 (Aristarchus, Copernicus, and Kepler) also provide a significant amount of ejecta, especially Copernicus crater.Quantitative Assessment of Exotic MaterialsTo quantitatively analyze the contribution from different distant ejecta sources, we calculated their thicknesses in the study region using the power-law model modified by [6]. According to this calculation, Harpalus contributes the most ejecta to Em4/P58 (\&\#8764;10 cm), followed by two Copernican-aged craters Copernicus (\&\#8764;8 cm) and Aristarchus (\&\#8764;3 cm). Contributions from Kepler and R\&\#252;mker E are negligible. The ejecta thickness calculation agrees well with the ejecta distribution tracing, suggesting Harpalus is the main ejecta source, dominating the overall ejecta thickness for Em4/P58. Sharp B crater is OLDER than Em4/P58 based on its morphological characteristics, thus its ejecta does NOT overlie Em4/P58.The percentage of contributions from each ejecta source crater was calculated to first-order by employing [7]\&\#8217;s regolith gardening model. Considering the CE-5 mare basalts have an age of between 1.6-1.7 Ga, the top \&\#8764;74 cm regolith is mixed up. Because the total ejecta thickness from studied source craters is \&\#8764;22 cm, we can assume all ejecta layers are mixed into the first \&\#8764;74 cm of lunar regolith. This yields the overall exotic components at the CE-5 landing site of \&\#8764;9\%. Harpalus (\&\#8764;6\%), Copernicus (\&\#8764;2\%), and Aristarchus (\&\#8764;1\%) are the three most important source craters, agreeing with the map results (Fig. 1).Figure 1. Ejecta distribution of major source craters in the Northern Oceanus ProcellarumDiscussion \&amp; ConclusionIn addition to exotic materials delivered by the distal impacts (e.g., Harpalus, Copernicus, and Aristarchus), three other types of exotic materials have high scientific significance. The first one is exotic components from subjacent and adjacent highlands by lateral mixing [8], the second type of exotic components may originate from silica-rich domes, and the third one from the meteorites. However, the overall composition of the lunar regolith are from the local ({\textasciitilde}91\%) mare basalts erupted by Rima Sharp (Qian et al., 2021b) with foreign materials from mainly Harpalus, Copernicus, and Aristarchus craters (Qian et al., 2021c). All of the local and exotic materials can be used to answer at least some of the scientific questions listed by Qian et al. (2021c) to deepen our understanding of the Moon.References[1] Hiesinger, et al. (2011) Spec. Pap. Geol. Soc. Am., 477, 1\&\#8211;51.[2] Qian, et al. (2021) EPSL, 555, 116702.[3] Xie, et al.

However, existing methods are insufficient to address the complexities associated with sparse features and elevated outlier rates, primarily due to significant discrepancies in perspective. This paper proposes a semantic map registration method using a genetic algorithm to handle larger perspective differences. We introduce a potential corresponding point selection strategy to eliminate outliers. A fitness calculation model has been developed that closely integrates semantic and geometric features. To assist in avoiding local minima and accelerating convergence, an adaptive mutation step adjustment strategy is proposed. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves accuracy and success rates. Successful registration can still be achieved even when the perspective difference exceeds 90{$^\circ$}. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each model.},

On spacecraft mechanisms the route to achieving these goals brings its own unique challenges. This review describes the problems posed by the space environment, the types of tribological component used on spacecraft and the approaches taken to their lubrication. It is shown that in many instances lubrication needs can be met by synthetic oils having exceedingly low volatilities, but that at temperature extremes the only means of reducing friction and wear is by solid lubrication. As the demands placed on space engineering increase, innovatory approaches will be needed to solve future tribological problems. The direction that future developments might take is anticipated and discussed.},

The mechanical properties of asteroid material are also important in the interpretation of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact. Here we perform a detailed morphological analysis of the surface boulders on Dimorphos using images, the primary data set available from the DART mission. We estimate the bulk angle of internal friction of the boulders to be 32.7\,{\textpm}\,2.\,5{$^\circ$} from our measurements of the roundness of the 34 best-resolved boulders ranging in size from 1.67--6.64\,m. The elongated nature of the boulders around the DART impact site implies that they were likely formed through impact processing. Finally, we find striking similarities in the morphology of the boulders on Dimorphos with those on other rubble pile asteroids (Itokawa, Ryugu and Bennu). This leads to very similar internal friction angles across the four bodies and suggests that a common formation mechanism has shaped the boulders. Our results provide key inputs for understanding the DART impact and for improving our knowledge about the physical properties, the formation and the evolution of both near-Earth rubble-pile and binary asteroids.},

This review presents the benefits and foreseeable challenges of using faster locomotive solutions for space exploration. Information is provided regarding the set of missions that would benefit most from faster locomotive capabilities. Starting by understanding the theoretical framework governing the interaction of wheeled robots operating over loose, sandy terrains, we delve into the foundation of Bekker's classic terramechanic equations---the most frequently used method to predict mobile robots off-road performance. We highlight its limitations and review the efforts that have been made to expand the range of application of these theories to dynamic wheel--soil interactions. We analyze the existing experimental evidence on the effects of increasing traveling velocities under earthbound, off-road conditions. By paying special attention to previous experiences on the lunar surface, we outline the challenges that the combination of irregular terrains and a reduced-gravity field may pose to a fast-moving exploration rover. The principles, mathematical models, experimental evidence, and experiences presented in this review are meant to aid in the identification of poorly understood and insufficiently studied aspects regarding high-speed extraterrestrial surface mobility.},

Efficient space resource utilization is also vital for extraterrestrial settlements. The Collaborative In-Situ Resources Utilisation (CISRU) project has developed a software suite comprising five key modules. The first module manages multi-agent autonomy, facilitating communication between agents and mission control. The second focuses on environment perception, employing AI algorithms for tasks like environment segmentation and object pose estimation. The third module ensures safe navigation, covering obstacle avoidance, social navigation with astronauts, and cooperation among robots. The fourth module addresses manipulation functions, including multi-tool capabilities and tool-changer design for diverse tasks in In-Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) scenarios. Finally, the fifth module controls cooperative behaviour, incorporating astronaut commands, Mixed Reality interfaces, map fusion, task supervision, and error control. The suite was tested using an astronaut-rover interaction dataset in a planetary environment and GMV SPoT analogue environments. Results demonstrate the advantages of E4 autonomy and AI in space systems, benefiting astronaut-robot collaboration.

  abstract = {Plasma parcels are observed propagating from the Sun out to the large coronal heights monitored by the Heliospheric Imagers (HI) instruments onboard the NASA STEREO spacecraft during September 2007. The source region of these out-flowing parcels is found to corotate with the Sun and to be rooted near the western boundary of an equatorial coronal hole. These plasma enhancements evolve during their propagation through the HI cameras' fields of view and only becoming fully developed in the outer camera field of view. We provide evidence that HI is observing the formation of a Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) where fast solar wind from the equatorial coronal hole is interacting with the slow solar wind of the streamer belt located on the western edge of that coronal hole. A dense plasma parcel is also observed near the footpoint of the observed CIR at a distance less than 0.1AU from the Sun where fast wind would have not had time to catch up slow wind. We suggest that this low-lying plasma enhancement is a plasma parcel which has been disconnected from a helmet streamer and subsequently becomes embedded inside the corotating interaction region.},

(2) To what degree did basin impact melt seas undergo differentiation? We compiled a 1:200,000-scale geological map of the lunar Orientale basin, focusing on identifying the most widespread and accessible occurrences of impact melt deposits from the basin-forming impact to help guide sample-return missions to Orientale and especially to other undated lunar basins using the identification and interpretation strategies for Orientale. We assess the size of craters excavating through basalt cap rock that may have exhumed datable basin impact melt, and we assess the possibility of impact melt sampling and melt differentiation for the large complex crater Maunder. We also provide guidance for distinguishing impact melt produced by larger complex craters from excavated basin melt and determining whether such craters may have also sampled through the entire melt deposit. Our analysis finds six such sites that are predicted to have the same age---that of the Orientale-forming event---and provides guidance for assessing possible melt differentiation. Future missions could collect samples from these sites for in situ age dating and petrologic assessment and/or for return to Earth and subsequent age dating and analysis. By sampling and dating impact melt of known provenance from the Moon's dozens of large basins, future work can anchor the chronostratigraphy of the Moon's formative years. Such information could be scaled to infer Earth's large impactor flux around the time of life's first emergence.}

  abstract = {This review describes the principles and summarizes the challenges of analytical methods based on optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in space applications, with a particular focus on Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). Over the past decade, LIBS has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for space exploration and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) of celestial bodies. Its implementation has been suggested for various segments of the Space Resources Value Chain, including prospecting, mining, and beneficiation. Current missions to Mars, including the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity rover, the SuperCam on the Perseverance rover, and the MarSCoDe on the Zhurong rover, are considered flagship applications of LIBS. Despite neither the Pragyan rover nor the Vikram lander waking from the lunar night, the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission marks another milestone in the development of LIBS instruments, with further missions, including commercial ones, anticipated. This paper reviews the deployment of LIBS payloads on Mars rovers, upcoming missions prospecting the Moon and asteroids, and LIBS analysis of meteorites. Additionally, it highlights the importance of data processing specific to space applications, emphasizing recent trends in transfer learning. Furthermore, LIBS combined with other spectroscopic techniques (e.g., Raman Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) represents an intriguing platform with comprehensive analytical capabilities. The review concludes by emphasizing the significance of LIBS-based contributions in advancing our understanding of celestial bodies and paving the way for future space exploration endeavors.},

The aim of this work is to demonstrate the viability of cloud offloading in a low level and intensive computing task: a vision-based navigation assistance of a service mobile robot. In order to do so, a prototype, running over a ROS-based mobile robot (Erratic by Videre Design LLC) is presented. The information extracted from on-board stereo cameras will be used by a private cloud platform consisting of five bare-metal nodes with AMD Phenom 965 {\texttimes} 4 CPU, with the cloud middleware Openstack Havana. The actual task is the shared control of the robot teleoperation, that is, the smooth filtering of the teleoperated commands with the detected obstacles to prevent collisions. All the possible offloading models for this case are presented and analyzed. Several performance results using different communication technologies and offloading models are explained as well. In addition to this, a real navigation case in a domestic circuit was done. The tests demonstrate that offloading computation to the Cloud improves the performance and navigation results with respect to the case where all processing is done by the robot.}

Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.},

  abstract = {The surface heat flux provides important constraints on the present-day thermal state of the lunar interior. In situ surface heat flux measurements, performed during the Apollo program, obtained surface heat flux values of 21\&\#177;3 and 14\&\#177;2 mW/m2 at the landing sites of Apollo 15 and 17, respectively [1]. Recently, a peak heat flux of {\textasciitilde}180 mW/m2 was inferred by [2] from the Chang\&\#8217;E 1 and 2 data at the Compton-Belkovich location. A lower bound for global lunar heat flux of {\textasciitilde}6 mW/m2, based on measurements of the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment onboard LRO, has been suggested for Region 5, a location at the eastern edge of Haworth crater [3]. In addition to heat flux measurements, global thermal expansion/contraction estimates can be used to constrain the thermal state of the interior throughout lunar history [4].Differences between the surface heat flux measurements, even for geographically close regions, indicate a high heat flux variability on the Moon. Previous work investigated regional combinations of crustal thermophysical properties (thickness, density, thermal conductivity), distribution of heat producing elements (HPEs), and heat flux coming from the mantle to explain the differences between the two Apollo measurements [5,6]. The results of these regional-scale models suggested\&\#160; heat-flux values of 7-13 mW/m2\&\#160; and 12-14 mW/m2\&\#160; at the crust-mantle interface and for the global average, respectively. These studies also highlighted the need to include regional-scale scenarios within global thermal evolution models and investigate key aspects (e.g., the geographical extent of a subsurface KREEP layer), in order to relate local heat flux measurements and regional-scale estimates to the global properties of the Moon.\&\#160;Here, we construct 3D thermal evolution models using the fluid solver GAIA [7]. The interior dynamics of the Moon are simulated over 4.5 billion years, by solving the conservation equations of mass, linear momentum and thermal energy. Similar to [8], we account for\&\#160; spatially variable crustal thickness, derived from gravity and topography data [9] (Fig. 1a). We consider higher HPEs abundances in the PKT and crust compared to the mantle, and compute the interior dynamics (Fig. 1b) using an Arrhenius viscosity for diffusion creep similar to [11]. This setup is designed to allow for an extensive investigation of lunar crustal properties and their spatial variability.In our models we vary critical parameters such as the location, size, thermal conductivity, and HPE enrichment of the PKT region, but also the location of a putative KREEP layer (i.e., within or below the crust). Finally, we consider various thermal conductivity values and HPE enrichment of the anorthositic crust, and initial temperature profile of the interior. In addition to present-day surface heat flux, we compute the heat flux at the crust-mantle interface and also estimate the time-variable thermal expansion/contraction during lunar evolution. These values are compared to all available constraints [1-6] to select best-fit models.Our models that are best compatible with the Apollo measurements are in agreement with [5] and [6]. These models have a bulk uranium content of 25 ppb [11], and show average and standard deviation surface and crust-mantle interface heat flux values of {\textasciitilde}14\&\#177;5 and {\textasciitilde}8\&\#177;1\&\#160; mW/m2, respectively (Fig. 2a and b). For the Compton-Belkovich anomaly, none of our models can reproduce the high heat flux value proposed by [2]. Therefore, we conclude that the inferred heat flux value of {\textasciitilde}180 mW/m2\&\#160;indicates either very specific local processes (e.g., overly high radiogenic enrichment) [2] or large measurement uncertainties.We find that, without considering 3D lateral variability in thermal conductivity across the lunar surface, measurably lower heat flux values at Region 5 [3] with respect to Apollo 15 \&amp; 17 require for KREEP material to extend at least partly beneath mare Serenitatis. In this case, the Apollo 15 measurement would be representative of the PKT average heat flux, while Apollo 17 would lie on its edge (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, a smaller PKT could imply that the low heat flux at Region 5 is caused by different phenomena, for instance a laterally variable thermal conductivity. Heat flux measurements that will be performed by the Farside Seismic Suite [12] at Schr\&\#246;dinger crater, if successful, will provide key information that would help to exclude one of these two scenarios, and thus potentially constrain the extent on the KREEP layer underneath PKT region.The full spatial variations of the surface heat flux on the Moon obtained by our models are an important step forward towards understanding the thermal history and present-day state of the lunar interior. Such models can help to put current and future heat flux measurements into a global context and to constrain the distribution of the KREEP layer beneath the PKT region. Future work will include a laterally variable thermal conductivity of the crust to test the effects of the spatial distribution of lunar regolith on the surface heat flow and subsurface temperature variations.References:[1] Langseth et al., 1976; [2] Siegler et al., 2023; [3] Paige \&amp; Siegler, 2016; [4] Andrews-Hanna et al. 2013; [5] Siegler and Smrekar, 2013; [6] Warren and Rasmussen, 1987; [7] H\&\#252;ttig et al., 2013; [8] Plesa et al., 2016;\&\#160; [9] Broquet \&amp; Andrews-Hanna, 2023; [11] Laneuville et al., 2013 [12] Panning et al., LPSC 2024.}

It is used for template matching or pattern recognition. Template can be considered a sub-image from the reference image, and the image can be considered as a sensed image. The objective is to establish the correspondence between the reference image and sensed image. It gives the measure of the degree of similarity between an image and template. This paper describes medical image registration by template matching based on Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The algorithm for template matching using NCC is implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm does the template matching and uses the CauchySchwartz's inequality to simplify the procedure. The developed algorithm is robust for similarity measure. An experimental result with medical images registration with noise and without noise is shown in the results section.},

  abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman spectroscopy have a high potential for in situ geochemical and mineralogical analyses for planetary exploration, in particular in combination. The SuperCam instrument onboard NASA's Mars 2020 rover will use both techniques together on another planet for the first time. The high-power pulsed LIBS laser ablates material, and a small luminous plasma is produced for spectral analysis. The laser--matter interaction and the plasma shock wave can alter the sample surface, and new molecules can be produced, which deposit close to the LIBS ablation crater. Subsequent Raman analysis might then not sample the original structure. Here, we investigated pure metals (Fe, Ni, and Ti), the iron-containing oxides hematite and ilmenite, and a fragment of the Gibeon meteorite in terrestrial ambient conditions, in simulated Martian atmospheric conditions, and in vacuum. LIBS ablation craters and their close proximity were studied with subsequent Raman analysis. Our analysis shows that Earth and Mars atmosphere provide enough oxygen in the LIBS plasma to produce oxides with metals from the sample. These can then be observed in the Raman data. Also, carbon was seen in some of the Raman data from the sample after the LIBS measurement. On hematite, a reduction of the mineral, that is, the presence of magnetite, was observed inside the LIBS crater for terrestrial and Martian atmospheric conditions and in vacuum. For the analysis and correct interpretation of Raman data it is important to be aware that alteration could have occurred by a preceding LIBS measurement. Raman analysis of several positions close to the LIBS ablation crater can help to infer the original and a possibly altered structure.}

  abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.}

The instrument has been used for analyzing both Raman and LIBS spectra of carbonates, sulfates, hydrous and anhydrous silicates, and iron oxide minerals in air. These experiments demonstrate that by focusing a frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd:YAG pulsed laser beam with a 10{\texttimes} beam expander to a 529-{$\mu$}m diameter spot on a mineral surface located at 9 m, it is possible to measure simultaneously both the remote Raman and LIBS spectra of calcite, gypsum and olivine by adjusting the laser power electronically. The spectra of calcite, gypsum, and olivine contain fingerprint Raman lines; however, it was not possible to measure the remote Raman spectra of magnetite and hematite at 9 m because of strong absorption of 532 nm laser radiation and low intensities of Raman lines from these minerals. The remote LIBS spectra of both magnetite and hematite contain common iron emission lines but show difference in the minor amount of Li present in these two minerals. Remote Raman and LIBS spectra of a number of carbonates, sulfates, feldspars and phyllosilicates at a distance of 9 m were measured with a 532-nm laser operating at 35 mJ/pulse and by changing photon flux density at the sample by varying the spot diameter from 10 mm for Raman to 530 {$\mu$}m for LIBS measurements. The complementary nature of these spectra is highlighted and discussed. The combined Raman and LIBS system can also be re-configured to perform micro-Raman and micro-LIBS analyses, which have applications in trace/residue analysis and analysis of very small samples in the nano-gram range. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Coupling of different driven components is needed in a direct mechanical drive system. The majority of drive elements, such as gear reducers, lead screws, and a variety of other components, are powered by a shaft supported by many bearings. A drive shaft is slightly misaligned due to the couple's stiffness. The objective of the power transmission relation is to transmit torque from the driving shaft to the tube while accounting for shaft misalignment. Unnecessary wear pressures on the shaft bearings may be caused by shaft misalignment. There are few conventional solutions for misalignment issues, such as Oldham's coupling and universal joints, which have many disadvantages. Thompson's constant velocity (CV) coupling addresses these issues by reducing side loads, increasing misalignment, increasing running speeds, improving transmission performance, and more. The nature of constant velocity joints is investigated in this article, as well as their optimization. Many academics' research on transmission relations and constant speed joints is summarized in this article.},

So does the Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) rover IDEFIX, which is developed by the French Centre National d'{\'E}tudes Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to explore the surface of the Martian moon Phobos. It is equipped with a locomotion system responsible for the movements.The software for the rover locomotion system (LOCO-SW) translates system-level commands into actions executed by the locomotion system while monitoring the status of its mechanical and electrical components. To do so, it takes care of the following tasks: Reception of telecommands, sending of housekeeping telemetry, timing, inter-subsystem communication and signaling, processing of telecommands, SpaceWire communication with the LOCO electronic box for actuator control and monitoring of the sensor data. Few functionalities can rest upon existing frameworks, though many features have to be designed particularly for IDEFIX. The paper will present how they are defined and realized while various quality goals are fulfilled. Comprehensive testing is conducted to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the software architecture. The test suite comprises unit tests and regression testing on hardware similar to flight hardware, as well as tests in simulation. These tests validate the functionality and performance of the software architecture and show its suitability for the MMX locomotion system. This paper focuses on the architecture, design and testing of the LOCO-SW. The design of the software will be presented, and the decisions will be linked back to the requirements and use cases that motivate the design.},

  abstract = {The imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), a stereoscopic, multispectral camera, is described in terms of its capabilities for studying the Martian environment. The camera's two eyes, separated by 15.0 cm, provide the camera with range-finding ability. Each eye illuminates half of a single CCD detector with a field of view of 14.4{\texttimes}14.0{$^\circ$} and has 12 selectable filters. The {\textflorin}/18 optics have a large depth of field, and no focussing mechanism is required; a mechanical shutter is avoided by using the frame transfer capability of the 512{\texttimes}512 CCD. The resolving power of the camera, 0.98 mrad/pixel, is approximately the same as the Viking Lander cameras; however, the signal-to-noise ratio for IMP greatly exceeds Viking, approaching 350. This feature along with the stable calibration of the filters between 440 and 1000 nm distinguishes IMP from Viking. Specially designed targets are positioned on the Lander; they provide information on the magnetic properties of wind-blown dust, measure the wind vectors, and provide radiometric standard reflectors for calibration. Also, eight low-transmission filters are included for imaging the Sun directly at multiple wavelengths, giving IMP the ability to measure dust opacity and potentially the water vapor content. Several experiments beyond the requisite color panorama are described in detail: contour mapping of the local terrain, multispectral imaging of the surrounding rock and soil to study local mineralogy, viewing of three wind socks, measuring atmospheric opacity and water vapor content, and estimating the magnetic properties of wind-blown dust. This paper is intended to serve as a guide to understanding the scientific integrity of the IMP data that will be returned from Mars starting on July 4, 1997.},

This outcrop is a terrestrial morphological and possibly mineralogical analogue for similar formations that will likely be investigated by the Curiosity rover at Gale Crater. Our results demonstrate that fast LIBS analysis can generate semiquantitative chemical profiles in subminute times using automated data processing tools. Therefore, the LIBS instrument can be an invaluable tactical tool on the Curiosity rover for remote, rapid geochemical survey of layered outcrops, thus serving daily operational needs. The derived chemical profiles, supported by the range of minerals identified by Raman spectroscopy, is consistent with the products of a continental evaporitic lake. In the framework of future surface exploration on Mars, a combined Raman/LIBS investigation may provide a rapid mineralogical/chemical evaluation of targets that can be useful for selecting samples to be eventually collected for sample return purposes or for selecting sample sites to be drilled in the search for astrobiology-relevant species. {\copyright} 2013 American Geophysical Union.

Previous works mapped isolated boulders in the area but did not find any signs of fresh mass wasting activity. Here, we report on 48 newly discovered rockfall locations inside and around the landing characterization area. The freshness of many rockfalls at these locations is evidenced by the presence of prominent deep tracks. They tend to occur in common geologic settings, including possible small secondary craters and rounded isolated mounds which are widespread in the region. We argue that impact cratering played an important role in preconditioning slopes for rockfalls and distributing loose material, but specific triggers are elusive. Our geospatial measurements of rockfalls in Oxia Planum also enable estimating geotechnical properties (bearing capacity) of surface materials for the first time. We show that the bearing capacity of soil, a quantity relevant to the rover's ability to traverse the area, is sufficient to support its weight. The presence of rockfalls in Oxia Planum opens up new possibilities for sampling geologic units otherwise inaccessible to the rover.},

  abstract = {Each Mars Exploration Rover carries an integrated suite of scientific instruments and tools called the Athena science payload. The primary objective of the Athena science investigation is to explore two sites on the Martian surface where water may once have been present, and to assess past environmental conditions at those sites and their suitability for life. The remote sensing portion of the payload uses a mast called the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) that provides pointing for two instruments: the Panoramic Camera (Pancam), and the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES). Pancam provides high-resolution, color, stereo imaging, while Mini-TES provides spectral cubes at mid-infrared wavelengths. For in-situ study, a five degree-of-freedom arm called the Instrument Deployment Device (IDD) carries four more tools: a Microscopic Imager (MI) for close-up imaging, an Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) for elemental chemistry, a M{\"o}ssbauer Spectrometer (MB) for the mineralogy of Fe-bearing materials, and a Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) for removing dusty and weathered surfaces and exposing fresh rock underneath. The payload also includes magnets that allow the instruments to study the composition of magnetic Martian materials. All of the Athena instruments have undergone extensive calibration, both individually and using a set of geologic reference materials that are being measured with all the instruments. Using a MER-like rover and payload in a number of field settings, we have devised operations processes that will enable us to use the MER rovers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses concerning past environmental conditions and habitability at the landing sites.},

  abstract = {Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology has been extensively applied in Chinese lunar exploration. The first attempt to survey the Moon\&\#8217;s subsurface using a GPR onboard a rover was made during the Chang\&\#8217;E-3 (CE-3) mission, which featured dual-frequency channels (G.Y. Fang, et al., 2014). The identical Lunar Penetrating Radar used in the CE-3 mission, was successfully deployed during the Chang\&\#8217;E-4 (CE-4) mission. It effectively explored the subsurface structure to a depth of {\textasciitilde} 40m within the South Pole-Aitken Basin, located on the farside of the moon (C.L. Li, et al., 2020).Another remarkable design is the GPR of the Chang'e-5 (CE-5) mission. Because GPR for the CE-5 mission was mounted on the lander rather than on the rover, it was necessary to break the conventional design pattern. To address this challenge, an antenna-array radar was deployed,making the first application in the deep space mission. The array radar is named the Lunar Regolith Penetrating Radar (LRPR). The LRPR comprises a controller, a pair of transmitter and receiver, a distribution unit, a cable assembly, and an antenna array, which consists of 12 ultra-wideband time-domain antennas. As shown in Fig.1, these antennas are mounted asymmetrically around the drilling system as the bottom of the lander. Operating under a multiview/multistatic configuration, one antenna transmits while the other 11 antennas receive backscattered echoes during one measurement period(Y.X. Li, et al., 2019). Such configuration allows for the collection of 132 trace data. The complete measurement stage for the 12 transmitting antennas lasts {\textasciitilde}18 minutes.The Chinese CE-6 mission was successfully launched on May 3rd, 2024. The CE-6 landing zone has been selected to lie within the lunar farside South Pole\&\#8211;Aitken (SPA) basin in the southern part of the Apollo basin (150\&\#8211;158\&\#176; W, 41\&\#8211;45\&\#176; S), a site that provides access to a diversity of SPA material (see Fig.3). The CE-6 lander also carries the same radar instrument used in CE-5 mission, the LRPR. The primary objective of the LRPR is to investigate the interior structure of the local regolith and identify potential underground hazards that could pose risks to the drilling activity. Understanding the interior structures of lunar regolith is crucial for comprehending surface resulting from processes, such as impact cratering. Local stratigraphy provides the contextual information for interpreting the origin of samples collected from both the surface and the drilling core.In this report, we will detail the signal calibration, data processing procedures of the array radar, and present the results obtained from the CE-5 LRPR. The CE-6 LRPR is expected to commence operations by the end of May. If successful, we will provide updates on the new results obtained. Given that the scheduled CE-6 landing site is situated within the most prominent SPA basin(see Fig.3), we are hopeful that the LRPR will unveil new discoveries.Fig.1 Layout of the LRPR antennas around the drilling core onboard the CE-5 and CE-6 lander. (a) Side view and (b) bottom view of the antenna array. Antennas \#1\&\#8211;\#10 are aligned at the bottom of the CE-5 lander, while antennas \#11 and \#12 are installed separately.Fig. 2 LRPR observations at the CE-5 drill-sampling site. (a) Variation of the drill bit force along the depths. The horizontal axis is force (N). The drilling system collected the rotation angle of a photoelectric encoder each second; then, this angle was converted to the distance of the drilling core movement to obtain the depth of the bit position. (b) LRPR radar image before drilling. The vertical axis is depth (cm), and zero-depth corresponds to the interface air/soil. The horizontal axis is the distance from the drill bit (cm).

  abstract = {AbstractIn this study, we present several ways in which a rover wheel can be used as a tool to study regolith dynamics. We demonstrate specific analysis methods by conducting numerical simulations of a simple rover wheel traversing a bed of regolith. The simulation data is used to analyze the general flow behavior of granular material around a wheel in a reduced-gravity environment.IntroductionIn the mid-2020s, the Martian Moons eXploration mission (MMX) will visit Phobos and Deimos, the moons of Mars. The key science objectives of the Japanese mission are to clarify the origins of the Martian moons and to investigate the mechanisms behind the evolution of these bodies. During the MMX mission, the French Space Agency (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) will deploy a small, 25\&\#160;kg, wheeled rover to the surface of Phobos [4, 6]. Wheeled rovers have been used to explore the Moon and Mars, but they have never been used to traverse small-body surfaces. Like the Moon and Mars, Phobos is thought to be covered by a layer of loose regolith. Its low-gravity environment, however, is comparable to that of a large asteroid. As such, the MMX rover will serve primarily as a technology demonstration. It will be used to evaluate the performance of a wheeled locomotion system on a granular surface in milli-gravity conditions.The MMX rover provides a unique opportunity to make in-situ observations on the surface of Phobos. Among other instruments, the rover will be equipped with two navigation cameras (NavCams) and two wheel cameras (WheelCams). The WheelCams will capture the direct interaction between the rover\&\#8217;s wheels and surface of Phobos. When combined with images and engineering data, a rover\&\#8217;s wheels can become powerful tools for studying the surface mechanical properties of soil. For instance, an extensive study on the cohesion and frictional properties of the Martian surface was conducted by observing trenches created by Spirit and Opportunity, the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) [2]. In another example, the strength and stiffness properties of lunar soil were estimated using lander images and wheel sinkage estimates from China\&\#8217;s Yutu rover on the Cheng\&\#8217;E-3 mission [1].The objective of this work is to present different types of regolith-focused studies that can be made by treating a rover wheel as an excavation tool. We begin by providing a survey of techniques that have been employed in the past. Then, we demonstrate how numerical modeling can be used to augment in-situ observations from actual planetary missions.SimulationsWheel-regolith simulations are conducted using the soft-sphere DEM implementation in the open-source code Chrono [3, 5]. For simplicity, we consider a generic wheel design that consists of a cylindrical hub and paddle-like grousers. The rover wheel is constructed in Chrono using two different methods. The first method consists of representing the wheel as an assembly of cylinders and boxes. In the second method, the wheel is imported into the simulations as a custom triangular mesh. Comparing the results for the two different wheel models helps to validate the meshing technique so that more complex wheel designs can be used in future simulations.Preliminary regolith beds consist of approximately 150,000 mono-disperse spherical particles.\&\#160; The particles have material strength properties comparable to quartz sand and are settled in a rectangular container with random-loose packing. After the particles settle, the wheel is added to the simulations so that it sits just above the surface of the bed. We let the wheel sink into the granular material under some gravity level and then rotate the wheel at a low and constant speed. The wheel makes a quarter of a turn and is free to translate in the vertical and horizontal directions. Position, velocity, force, and torque information is reported for the wheel and all of the particles.ResultsSimulations are conducted for Earth and reduced-gravity levels and for varied magnitudes of particle cohesion. Preliminary results for wheel sinkage and slip are reported, with particular focus on the motion and behavior of the grains directly beneath the wheel. The simulation results are discussed in the larger context of how to use wheel-regolith modeling to augment surface-science experiments performed by actual planetary rovers.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank ISAE-SUPAERO and the Centre National d\&\#8217;\&\#201;tudes Spatiales (CNES) for financially supporting this research effort.References[1] Gao, Yang, et al.

This paper investigates the raster map-merging problem in the absence of a common reference coordinate system and the relative position information of UAVs, and proposes a raster map-merging method with a directed crossover multidimensional perturbation variational genetic algorithm (DCPGA). The algorithm uses an optimization function reflecting the degree of dissimilarity between the overlapping regions of two raster maps as the fitness function, with each possible rotation translation transformation corresponding to a chromosome, and the binary encoding of the coordinates as the gene string. The experimental results show that the algorithm could converge quickly and had a strong global search capability to search for the optimal overlap area of the two raster maps, thus achieving map merging.},

  abstract = {Carl Sagan's reflections emphasize the boundless potential awaiting humanity in space, regardless of our past achievements or failures. This optimistic view resonates with current space agencies, private space startups, and enthusiasts, all driven by the ambition to make humans a multiplanetary species. Key examples include Elon Musk's goal to terraform Mars, despite skepticism from some scientists. Space exploration faces numerous challenges, such as dealing with space debris, unpredictable climates on other planets, and the complexities of missions like NASA's attempts to land on Mars. Space missions confront obstacles in navigation, life detection, and sample testing. Astronauts also encounter physical and mental limitations due to the harsh conditions of space. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial tool in addressing these challenges. AI is categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, with reinforcement learning being a distinct method used for autonomous applications. Neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, mimic human behavior for tasks like image inspection and sequential data handling. Deep learning aids in complex pattern recognition, and natural language processing facilitates speech recognition and development. Expert systems enhance decision-making processes. This review explores various AI applications in space missions. AI technologies have been integral to recent missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which uses AI for object and galaxy inspection, and the ARTEMIS mission, which employs AI in designing new spacesuits. SpaceX leverages AI for reusable launch vehicles, while the European Space Agency (ESA) uses AI for autonomous spacecraft to cut mission costs. India plans to launch the AI-based Vyommitra robot in space and has utilized AI in the Chandrayaan mission for landing and navigation. Mars exploration benefits significantly from AI, given the planet's unpredictable weather and cratered surface. AI technologies, like the OASIS system, aid in mission planning and rover navigation. AI also supports space agriculture research, as demonstrated by the UAE's habitat design efforts. Beyond Mars, AI influences the exploration of asteroids and deep space. AI techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, assist in space dynamics calculations to predict asteroid trajectories and potential Earth impacts. AI has been employed in Voyager missions to seek extraterrestrial life and in the Hubble telescope for imaging exoplanets. AI enhances satellite communication and automates tasks on space stations, saving time and costs. Weather satellites, powered by AI, provide crucial alerts for natural disasters. Despite the challenges, AI offers promising solutions for advancing space exploration. The historical tendency to deem certain challenges insurmountable is gradually shifting, as past impossibilities, like human flight and space travel, have become historical milestones. This reinforces the importance of maintaining hope and persistence in the quest to explore space, as today's dreams may become tomorrow's history.},

  abstract = {Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an interesting and promising area of research, with a very high and direct impact on the application domain of visual inspection. Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately 25--30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.}

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent planetary exploration space missions, spacecraft are exposed to severe thermal environments that are sometimes more extreme than those experienced in earth orbits. The development of advanced thermal control materials and devices together with reliable and accurate measurements of their thermophysical properties are needed for the development of systems designed to meet the engineering challenges associated with these space missions. We provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art advanced passive thermal control materials and devices that are available for space applications, specifically, variable emissivity thermal control materials and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), radiofrequency (RF)-transparent and/or tunable solar absorptivity and total hemispherical emissivity thermal control materials, and a passive re-deployable radiator with advanced materials and insulation. Prior to our in-depth review of these thermal control materials, we briefly summarize the thermal environments surrounding spacecraft, the characteristics of thermophysical properties for spacecraft materials that differ from those of materials for ground use, and the significance of solar absorptivity and total hemispherical emissivity for passive thermal control in space. In all four topics of materials and devices, the following subjects are overviewed: the basic principle of passive thermal control techniques in space, the measurement of thermophysical properties of those novel materials, simulation and/or on-orbit verification thermal performance tests, degradation tests in space environments, and some aspects of the implementation of the above-described materials and devices in actual space missions.},

  abstract = {The lack of adequate stereo coverage and where available, lengthy processing time, various artefacts, and unsatisfactory quality and complexity of automating the selection of the best set of processing parameters, have long been big barriers for large-area planetary 3D mapping. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based solution, called MADNet (Multi-scale generative Adversarial u-net with Dense convolutional and up-projection blocks), that avoids or resolves all of the above issues. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this technique with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) 4.6 m/pixel images on Mars. Only a single input image and a coarse global 3D reference are required, without knowing any camera models or imaging parameters, to produce high-quality and high-resolution full-strip Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) in a few seconds. In this paper, we discuss technical details of the MADNet system and provide detailed comparisons and assessments of the results. The resultant MADNet 8 m/pixel CaSSIS DTMs are qualitatively very similar to the 1 m/pixel HiRISE DTMs. The resultant MADNet CaSSIS DTMs display excellent agreement with nested Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX), Mars Express's High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) DTMs at large-scale, and meanwhile, show fairly good correlation with the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) DTMs for fine-scale details. In addition, we show how MADNet outperforms traditional photogrammetric methods, both on speed and quality, for other datasets like HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE, without any parameter tuning or re-training of the model. We demonstrate the results for Oxia Planum (the landing site of the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rover 2023) and a couple of sites of high scientific interest.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;With respect to its counterpart, the lunar farside is characterized by few basaltic mare exposures. One of these, with a total surface area of approximately 12 000 km\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;, covers the floor of the {\textasciitilde}200 km diameter Tsiolkovskiy crater (20.4\&amp;\#176; S, 129.1\&amp;\#176; E) [1].\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The crater size frequency distributions (CSFDs) calculated for this crater led to different results. The age determination performed on the mare infilling resulted in an Imbrian-Erathostenian age of about 3.2 Ga [2], while a 3.6 Ga Late Imbrian age was derived from areas scattered on top of a long run-out landslide generated from the western rim and its surroundings [3-4].\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The spectral map produced for Tsiolkovskiy crater [5-6], performed on the {\textasciitilde}200 m/pixel Clementine UVVIS color ratio mosaic [7] (R: 750/415 nm; G: 750/1000 nm; B: 415/750 nm), and recently updated suggests for the crater floor the presence of three color units, characteristics of higher 415/750 nm ratio, higher 750/415 nm ratio and average 750/415 nm and 750/1000 nm ratios, defined by a different composition and/or age formation.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;In order to discriminate possible age differences ascribable to different eruptive events, on the basis of the spectral mapping we defined several areas for measuring the crater size-frequency distributions of the different color units on the crater floor. In addition, we calculated the age formation of Tsiolkovskiy crater itself by means of hummocky areas interpreted as impact melt identified in accordance to the geological mapping [5-6] performed on the {\textasciitilde}100 m/pixel LRO-WAC [8] global mosaic.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The CSFDs measurements have been performed on areas of at least 100 km\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt; using the CraterTools add-on [9] in the ArcGIS software on LRO-NAC [8] images with resolution ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 m/pixel. The exported data have then been plotted in the Craterstats2 software [10].\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The obtained results highlight that i) Tsiolkovskiy crater formed around 3.6 Ga, in agreement with [3], ii) three different age ranges are discernible and iii) these age ranges are correlated to each one of the three color units of the crater floor.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;This allows to reconstruct the evolution history of the crater and in particular of its crater floor, with particular focus also on its compositional variegation.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Acknowledgments\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;This research was supported by the European Union\&amp;\#8217;s Horizon 2020 under grant agreement No 776276-PLANMAP.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;References\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;[1] Whitford-Stark, J.L. \&amp; Hawke, B.R., XXXIII LPSC, pp. 861-862, 1982\&amp;\#160; [2] Pasckert, J.H. et al., Icarus, Vol. 257, pp. 336-354, 2015\&amp;\#160; [3] Boyce, J.M. et al., XXXXVII LPSC, 2471, 2016\&amp;\#160; [4] Boyce, J.M. et al., Icarus, Vol. 337, 2020\&amp;\#160; [5] Tognon, G. et al., EGU, 733, 2020\&amp;\#160; [6] Tognon, G. et al., EPSC, 581, 2020\&amp;\#160; [7] Lucey, P.G. et al., JGR, Vol. 105, pp. 20377-20386, 2000\&amp;\#160; [8] Robinson, M.S. et al., Space Sci.

The work aims at characterizing the surface morphology and compositional variation observed from orbital data including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera and Clementine UVVIS Warped Color Ratio mosaics, and attempts a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Tsiolkovskiy crater through both relative and absolute model age determinations. The results show a clear correlation between the geologic and spectral units and an asymmetric distribution of these units reflecting the oblique impact origin of the crater. Crater counts performed using the spectral units identified on the smooth crater floor returned distinct age ranges, suggesting the occurrence of at least three different igneous events, generating units characterized by particular compositions and/or degree of maturity. This work demonstrates the scientific value of Tsiolkovskiy crater for a better understanding of the volcanic evolution of the Moon and, in particular, of its far side.},

  abstract = {AbstractIncreasing the terrain awareness of planetary exploration rovers is one key technology for future space robotics to successfully accomplish long-distance and long-duration missions. In contrast to most of the existing algorithms that use visual or depth data for terrain classification, the approach presented in this study tackles the problem using proprioceptive sensing, for example, vibration or force measurements. The underlying assumption is that these signals, being directly modulated by the terrain properties, are well descriptive of a given surface. Therefore, terrain signature can be inferred via learning algorithms that are trained on either the signals directly or a signal-derived feature set. Following the latter approach, first, a physics-based signal augmentation process is presented that aims at maximizing the information content. Then, a feature selection algorithm based on a scoring system and an iterative search is developed to decrease the computational cost while preserving high classification accuracy. The resulting most informative feature subspace can be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. For comparison, the time histories of the selected proprioceptive signals are used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Results obtained from real experiments using the SherpaTT rover confirm that proprioceptive sensing is effective in predicting terrain type with an accuracy higher than 90\% for both algorithms in generalization tasks. When the two learning approaches are contrasted in extrapolation problems, for example, predicting observations acquired at previously unseen velocity or terrain, CNN outperforms the standard SVM. Furthermore, CNN holds the additional advantage of learning features automatically from signal spectrograms, reducing the need of a priori knowledge at the expense of higher computational efforts.},

By taking stereoscopic images of the area around IDEFIX up to the horizon (resolution of a few millimeters at 1~m), the navigation cameras aim to provide answers to a number of scientific questions, such as the origin of the color dichotomy, the nature of space weathering processes, and the extent of dust transport and exogenous contamination on Phobos. Here we present the IDEFIX navigation cameras, including their ground calibrations, and the science questions they are intended to address.

  abstract = {IntroductionWith the confirmation of water ice in the lunar polar regions [1], the Moon has recently come into the focus of attention of international space agencies again. Volatiles, specifically water and hydrogen, are important resources both for life support and for potential applications as fuels and propellants for spacecraft. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) of volatiles could significantly reduce the costs of a sustained presence on the Moon and could be beneficial for the future human deep space exploration of the solar system [2]. The detection of volatiles is therefore an important scientific goal for future robotic missions to the Moon.The LUVMI-X project (Lunar Volatiles Mobile Instrumentation \&\#8211; Extended) is developing an initial system design as well as payload and mobility breadboards for the detection of volatiles in the lunar polar region on a small, lightweight rover [3]. The LUVMI-X rover is shown in Figure 1. One proposed scientific payload is VOILA (Volatiles Identification by Laser Ablation), which is jointly developed by OHB System AG (OHB), Laser Zentrum Hannover (LZH), and the German Aerospace Center\&\#8217;s Institute of Optical Sensor Systems (DLR-OS). VOILA will use laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to analyze the elemental composition of the lunar surface, with a special focus on detecting and quantifying hydrogen and oxygen as indicators for water.LIBS is a versatile technique that requires only optical access to its target [4]. A LIBS spectrum is obtained within seconds, making it well-suited for quick analyses of multiple targets in proximity to the rover. LIBS was first used in space by the ChemCam instrument on board NASA\&\#8217;s Curiosity rover on Mars [5, 6]. The first LIBS instrument on the Moon was supposed to operate on board the Pragyan rover of India\&\#8217;s Chandrayaan-2 mission [7]. However, the Chandrayaan-2 lander failed a soft landing in September 2019.Here, we present a summary of the VOILA instrument design and its intended capabilities for volatiles detection at the lunar south pole.Instrument DesignWith an expected mass of about 3 kg, VOILA is designed to be more lightweight than the ChemCam instrument, but heavier and slightly more complex than the LIBS instrument designed for the Chandrayaan-2 mission. It will include an optical head with a focusing mechanism designed for working distances between 30 cm and 50 cm, which allows for compensation of uneven terrain or different rover configurations. The optical head is mounted at the front of the rover body and can rotate horizontally to select multiple targets of interest at each rover location.VOILA uses an actively Q-switched pulsed Yb:YAG laser developed by LZH with a pulse energy of at least 15\&\#160;mJ at a wavelength of 1030\&\#160;nm to ablate sample material, generating a laser-induced plasma that can be spectrally analyzed. The VOILA spectrometer will have a wavelength range from 350\&\#160;nm to 790\&\#160;nm at a spectral resolution of about 0.5\&\#160;nm, thereby covering atomic and ionic emission lines of the major rock forming elements (O, Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, K, Ti) and of hydrogen.LIBS measurements with VOILA are intended for the analysis of the topmost lunar surface layers. Simple depth profiling within millimeters could be achieved by repeated ablation of the same location on the surface. A single shot is expected to produce a crater of several millimeters depth due to the force of the outgoing shockwave in the regolith.Laboratory StudiesPreliminary LIBS studies in near-vacuum (0.1 Pa of air) were made with the high-resolution LIBS setup at DLR-OS to determine the VOILA instrument requirements. Figure 2 shows a LIBS spectrum of lunar regolith simulant Exolith LMS-1 in which all major rock forming elements could be observed within 350 nm to 790 nm. A laser energy of 15 mJ/pulse was found to produce a very intense plasma when focused to a spot of 300 \&\#181;m diameter. For a basalt/gypsum mixture with a water concentration of about 1.5 wt\%, the H I line at 656.3 nm was successfully detected, see Figure 3. The signal to noise ratio is about 4.3 for this line, indicating that even lower concentrations can be detected. Furthermore, the high-resolution echelle spectrometer used for the measurements has a low throughput that will be exceeded by the VOILA instrument itself.ConclusionVOILA is a new LIBS instrument for the detection of volatiles at the lunar south pole. Initial experiments show that LIBS can be employed at low pressures and that clear signals of all major rock-forming elements and of hydrogen can be obtained in the specified spectral range of VOILA. The pulse energy of VOILA is at least 15 mJ, which is achievable by the laser prototype developed by LZH. The successful detection of hydrogen is promising, but the instrument should also be qualified with measurements of real water ice at low concentrations. Future studies should also investigate whether water ice can be distinguished from other hydrogen and oxygen sources. New results obtained with the VOILA demonstration setup developed by OHB, LZH and DLR will be presented at the conference.AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by the European Union\&\#8217;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 822018.References[1] Li S. et al.

  abstract = {In view of ESA's horizon goal of establishing a human presence on the Moon by 2040, the Earth's moon is increasingly coming into the focus of research and industry. Lunar exploration can benefit from systems developed for low-Earth orbit, as the environmental conditions are overlapping. The development of the CubeSat industry in recent decades has led to a revolution in access to near-Earth space. The goal of Neurospace and its partners is to explore the similarities of both environments for a direct application of existing CubeSat technologies for lunar exploration. Using an open standard and a tiered approach for the development of lunar rovers will allow future missions to focus more on the actual use case rather than the individual development, qualification, and certification of required components. This paper introduces the HiveR rover and provides a classification of the future importance of robotic systems for lunar exploration. It also discusses, in review of past lunar missions, how such rovers differ from previous lunar rovers, and how important they can be in supporting increasingly complex missions. The similarities and differences between the low-Earth orbit and the lunar surface are outlined. Based on this, the new challenges in adapting existing CubeSat technologies for robotics on the lunar surface will be discussed and initial solutions presented. As examples of potential payloads, various experiments are presented, such as a robot arm that was developed to fit in a 1 U volume. It can be used for docking operations between individual systems or various tool handling operations.},

  abstract = {ispace is a company whose vision is to expand and sustain humanity's presence in space by utilizing resources available on the Moon. ispace previously developed the Sorato rover for the Hakuto Google Lunar XPRIZE team, and is now developing its own lunar lander and its next generation of lunar rovers. The Sorato rover was a simple 4-wheel skid steer rover that comprises a redundant controller architecture, 4 cameras, an IMU, a surface radio (communication to Earth is via a lander) and a time-of-flight sensor for hazard detection and avoidance. At under 4kg, it was a highly integrated design capable of carrying only a small payload. Although it didn't fly, it was qualified by ispace and became the baseline technology for its lunar rover program and input into its lunar lander program. ispace is now making an updated rover with a modular design. The rover is similar in design to Sorato but is 10kg with approximately 3.5kg of payload capacity with standardized payload spaces, designed for the anticipated payload requirements such as thermal environment, access to space, and access to the lunar surface. The architecture of this rover has two "levels." First, there is a lower level designed for high reliability, including all components necessary to "rove" or explore: defined as all functions related to command and data handling, locomotion and image / near-realtime video transfer for teleoperation. Second, there is a higher level designed for high performance, including additional cameras/ stereo cameras, and powerful COTS controller(s). The lower level is designed to support ispace's medium term rover missions and provide consistent baseline data across several missions, while the upper level is designed to be upgraded frequently and easily. ispace will fly a rover with both levels, ispace-internal payload and hosted payloads in an upcoming mission to demonstrate its technology development. The "lower" level of this rover design also serves as a rover bus, available to customers that want a proven rover platform including mobility and communications but wish to own and control the entire rover and its payload space.},

  abstract = {Abstract. On January 3, 2019, the Chang'e-4 (CE-4) probe successfully landed in the Von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n crater inside the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. With the support of a relay communication satellite "Queqiao" launched in 2018 and located at the Earth-Moon L2 liberation point, the lander and the Yutu-2 rover carried out in-situ exploration and patrol surveys, respectively, and were able to make a series of important scientific discoveries. Owing to the complexity and unpredictability of the lunar surface, teleoperation has become the most important control method for the operation of the rover. Computer vision is an important technology to support the teleoperation of the rover. During the powered descent stage and lunar surface exploration, teleoperation based on computer vision can effectively overcome many technical challenges, such as fast positioning of the landing point, high-resolution seamless mapping of the landing site, localization of the rover in the complex environment on the lunar surface, terrain reconstruction, and path planning. All these processes helped achieve the first soft landing, roving, and in-situ exploration on the lunar farside. This paper presents a high-precision positioning technology and positioning results of the landing point based on multi-source data, including orbital images and CE-4 descent images. The method and its results have been successfully applied in an actual engineering mission for the first time in China, providing important support for the topographical analysis of the landing site and mission planning for subsequent teleoperations. After landing, a 0.03 m resolution DOM was generated using the descent images and was used as one of the base maps for the overall rover path planning. Before each movement, the Yutu-2 rover controlled its hazard avoidance cameras (Hazcam), navigation cameras (Navcam), and panoramic cameras (Pancam) to capture stereo images of the lunar surface at different angles. Local digital elevation models (DEMs) with a 0.02 m resolution were routinely produced at each waypoint using the Navcam and Hazcam images. These DEMs were then used to design an obstacle recognition method and establish a model for calculating the slope, aspect, roughness, and visibility. Finally, in combination with the Yutu-2 rover mobility characteristics, a comprehensive cost map for path search was generated.By the end of the first 12 lunar days, the Yutu-2 rover has been working on the lunar farside for more than 300 days, greatly exceeding the projected service life. The rover was able to overcome the complex terrain on the lunar farside, and travelled a total distance of more than 300 m, achieving the "double three hundred" breakthrough. In future manned lunar landing and exploration of Mars by China, computer vision will play an integral role to support science target selection and scientific investigations, and will become an extremely important core technology for various engineering tasks.},

However, due to the difficulty of Martian rock image acquisition, the accuracy of the processing model is affected. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called ``GMSRI'' that is a mixture of real Mars images and synthetic counterparts which are generated by GAN. GMSRI aims to provide a set of Martian rock images sorted by the texture and spatial structure of rocks. This paper offers a detailed analysis of GMSRI in its current state: Five sub-trees with 28 leaf nodes and 30,000 images in total. We show that GMSRI is much larger in scale and diversity than the current same kinds of datasets. Constructing such a database is a challenging task, and we describe the data collection, selection and generation processes carefully in this paper. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the GMSRI by an image super-resolution task. We hope that the scale, diversity and hierarchical structure of GMSRI can offer opportunities to researchers in the Mars exploration community and beyond.},

The four seismometers, which had been operating continuously since each station was installed during the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions (between 1969 and 1972), were switched off, and our seismic window into the lunar interior has been closed ever since. Understanding the formation and evolution of the Moon via a direct interrogation of its internal structure is a high-priority science objective in both the current planetary decadal survey, and in NASA's Artemis Plan for human exploration. Towards that objective, NASA is preparing to re-open its window into the Moon's interior, by funding the development of the Farside Seismic Suite (FSS) under the PRISM (Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon) program. FSS will be the first seismic package delivered to the Moon's farside. It will launch in 2025, on a lander provided by Draper Laboratory as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, and will touch down in Schr{\"o}dinger Basin, one of the youngest impact basins on the Moon. FSS consists of two seismometers, both flight-proven on the Mars InSight mission: the vertical Very BroadBand (VBB) seismometer (the most sensitive seismometer ever built), and the Short Period (SP) sensor, the most mature compact triaxial sensor available for space applications. They are packaged together as a self-sufficient, lander-mounted payload that can survive independently, with power, communications and thermal control allowing continuous operation over multiple lunations. Thus FSS will outlive the delivery lander, and provide a long-lived seismic experiment capable of investigating deep lunar structure and the difference between near and farside activity; understanding how the lunar crust is affected by the development of an impact melt basin; and evaluating the current micrometeorite impact rate and local tectonic activity (with important implications for the Artemis human exploration program). By assessing the need for deployment and characterizing the lander seismic noise environment, FSS will also allow for key technical advancement and risk reduction for the future Lunar Geophysical Network mission, a candidate for NASA's New Frontiers 5 opportunity.}

Multiple regions of interest (ROIs) are selected at each site for comparison in both LAMP and previous mission data. Mare Crisium is more uniform in the FUV with some melt features, while the Gruithuisen Domes and Reiner Gamma both exhibit high FUV albedo ratios, pointing towards high feldspathic compositions (such as plagioclase) and space weathering. Melt features are highlighted and compared between the regions with contrasting compositions indicating differing subsurface lithologies and formation histories.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The proposed landing and exploration site, Amundsen crater, has been suggested several times [e.g., 1-3]. This is due to its location, size, and diverse geology that records a wide range of the south polar impact history [3-4]. Sunlit regions, regions with high Earth visibility, and the flat crater floor (Figure 1) enhance Amundsen crater\&\#8217;s capability for landing and operations as well as its ability to assess multiple science objectives [5]. This places Amundsen crater as an appealing target for future exploration. To address the local geology and history of the region, we performed 1:100,000 scale mapping of Amundsen crater [3-4]. Following, we identified five potential landing and exploration sites (Figure 1) that satisfy technical criteria, including shallow slopes, sufficient solar illumination, and Earth visibility. These sites also provide sample materials and can contribute to several scientific objectives (Figure 2).Regional Setting of Amundsen Crater: Amundsen crater, centered at 84.5\&\#176;S, 85.6\&\#176;E, is situated in the South Pole-Aitken basin (SPA) near the lunar South Pole. With a diameter of {\textasciitilde}100 km, Amundsen crater is the southernmost crater of its size on the Moon and, with its late Nectarian age [3], the youngest south polar complex crater of its size. Amundsen crater is located near the outer rim domain of the SPA basin [5], suggesting that ancient lunar rocks exposed by the SPA impact may have been reworked and redistributed by the Amundsen impact [3]. Therefore, sampling and analyzing the Amundsen crater materials and the younger crater materials that have strongly modified the surface will allow us to explore a wide range of south polar impact history and the processes that have reworked the crater materials over time.\&\#160;Areas of Interest (AoI): The Artemis program selected two candidate sites in the Amundsen region, "Nobile Rim 2" (AoI a) and "Amundsen Rim" (AoI b), while the Chinese ILRS potentially targets the Amundsen crater floor (AoI c, [1]). Additionally, we examined two AoIs, that fulfill scientific objectives beyond the aforementioned sites, on the plains near Idel'son L crater (AoI d) and the Rubin crater region on the Amundsen rim (AoI e). Based on traversability constraints, we present an assessment of their ability to address key science objectives.AoI a Artemis Nobile Rim 2: The Artemis candidate site \&\#8220;Nobile Rim 2\&\#8221; is located in the intercrater highland [3-4]. Most of the region has slopes of less than 5\&\#176;, low surface roughness, and adequate Sun and Earth visibility (Figure 2). The region is dominated by Eratosthenian crater materials [3], where a km2-sized permanently shadowed region (PSR) are present. Furthermore, the region offers the opportunity to sample undifferentiated pre-Nectarian basin material, potentially containing Nobile ejecta and SPA-derived material redistributed via younger craters.AoI b Artemis Amundsen Rim: Landing on the Amundsen rim benefits from advantageous Sun and Earth visibility. Shallow slopes exist, but are limited to the flat-topped rim segment, which is surrounded by steep slopes. Consequently, traversability is limited to the flat rim segment, where temperatures vary from 130 K in winter to 240 K in lunar summer [6]. The exploration site is located at the intersection of multiple craters and is capable of sampling materials excavated from depth by the Amundsen impact [3].\&\#160;AoI c Amundsen Crater Floor: The Amundsen crater floor has been previously proposed as an exploration site [1-2]. Extensive areas with shallow slopes facilitate access to the floor, including the large PSR, and promote traversability and mobility. Sun and Earth visibility [7] allow for solar power generation and direct communication with Earth in a favorable temperature regime [6]. The central peak represents the deepest derived materials that can be sampled, while materials on the crater floor can be studied to determine their nature and origin. This will offer valuable insights into the origin, distribution, and thickness of plains found elsewhere. The Amundsen crater floor provides one of the largest and coldest PSRs at the South Pole, where potential CO2 ice can be sampled [8].AoI d Plains near Idel\&\#8217;son L Crater: This site exemplifies the most diverse geology and offers favorable landing conditions (Figure 2). Investigating the terra-mantling unit [3] at this site will help to address the nature and timing of a potential resurfacing event [3]. In addition, volatile studies can be conducted in the PSRs.AoI e Rubin Crater Region: The northern rim of Amundsen crater, where Rubin crater is located, benefits from favorable landing conditions with a wide range of scientific objectives (Figure 2). The selected region is primarily characterized by its location on a massif that is considered to be the SPA rim [3]. The candidate site is covered by Amundsen ejecta, but features younger craters such as the Eratosthenian Rubin crater [3]. The Rubin crater is of particular interest as it may have reached the underlying massif and excavated SPA-derived material.Conclusion and Outlook: Based on our map, we have identified five AoIs that meet landing safety requirements and are capable of addressing key science objectives. We are not prioritizing one AoI over another, as the final selection will depend heavily on the design, scope, and duration of a mission. As a continuation of this study, we are producing higher resolution geological maps for each AoI to further refine site selection for different types of landed missions, setting the stage for maximum scientific return from the Amundsen crater region.References: [1] Hu et al.

We investigated the complex geological history of the region before and after the formation of Amundsen crater on the rims of the South Pole--Aitken (SPA) and Amundsen--Ganswindt basins. We present a new Amundsen crater formation age of {$\sim$}4.04 Ga, which, in contrast to previously derived ages, is based on non-light-plains terrain. The estimated maximum excavation depth for Amundsen crater is {$\sim$}8 km, and elevated concentrations of FeO near the crater suggest that Amundsen may have redistributed SPA-derived materials. Plains materials of various kinds were observed both inside and outside Amundsen crater and are estimated to be up to 350 m thick and {$\sim$}3.8 Ga old. A less cratered, tens of meters thick mantling unit indicates a resurfacing event {$\sim$}3.7 Ga ago. We highlight five potential exploration sites that satisfy technical constraints (such as shallow slopes, solar illumination, and Earth visibility), provide materials that can be sampled, and are capable of addressing multiple science objectives. Due to its accessibility and traversability, combined with its geologic diversity, proximity of permanently shadowed regions for studying volatile processes, and ability to address multiple science objectives, we confirm and reinforce the Amundsen crater region as a high-priority landing and exploration site.},

Given a complicated environment which has a long optimal path and a very large maximum cost value that results in high gradients, FFMM is faster than FMM. Furthermore, the tree structure result, a TP diagram of FFMM with path recovery rules, makes dynamic path planning of pursuit-evasion problems possible. By providing the shortest path produced by the path recovery rules in every time slot and the avoidance of re-planning in most situations, the pursuer now has a greater chance to intercept the evader in real time spectrum.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We examined the global distribution and geological context of lunar sites where olivine- and plagioclase-rich materials co-exist. These sites are areas showing plagioclase-rich spectra adjacent to areas showing olivine-rich spectra, and they extend over several hundreds of meters on the lunar surface. From an analysis of the high-spatial-resolution data obtained from the SELENE (Kaguya) multiband imager, we identified 14 co-existing occurrences among 49 olivine-rich sites located around large impact basins. We found that the co-existing occurrences are limited to a few sites among the olivine-rich sites in the Moscoviense, Crisium, and Imbrium basins, while six of seven olivine-rich sites in the Schr{\"o}dinger basin show co-existing occurrence. The geological features between the co-existing occurrences and the olivine-rich sites without plagioclase-rich materials showed no clear difference, but both types of site are found at fresh geological features located around the peak rings of impact basins. These results may suggest that the co-existing occurrences are closely related to the material heterogeneity of the peak ring regions. The heterogeneity could be formed by mixing of the olivine-rich mantle and the anorthosite-rich crust during impact basin formation, or it might be a reflection of the compositional heterogeneity of the lunar lower crust. For future sample return missions, the detailed information on the co-existing occurrences presented here might be useful for a sampling strategy to select a ``one-stop'' site that provides important information for the overall characterization of lunar mantle and crustal materials.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The surroundings of several impact basins on the lunar surface are known to contain olivine-rich sites that are dominated by olivine-rich spectra. Some of these olivine-rich sites co-exist with plagioclase-rich (purest anorthosite) materials, which are adjacent to the olivine-rich materials. The detailed study of these co-existing occurrences would provide critical constraints on the structure, composition, and evolution of the lunar crust and upper mantle. In this study, we examined the global distribution and geological context of co-existing occurrences based on the analysis of the high-spatial-resolution data obtained from the SELENE (Kaguya) multiband imager. Our results showed that the locations of co-existing occurrences are limited to fresh geological features around the peak rings of impact basins, and their spatial distributions are sporadic along the peak rings, suggesting material heterogeneity in these regions. The heterogeneity could be due to mixing of the olivine-rich mantle and anorthositic crust during the formation of the impact basins, or it may reflect a compositional heterogeneity of deep-seated materials in the lower crust. For future sample return missions, the detailed information on co-existing occurrences given here will be useful for a selecting a ``one-stop'' sampling site to better characterize the lunar mantle and crustal materials.           ,              Key Points                                                                We examined the global distribution and geological context of sites where olivine- and plagioclase-rich materials co-exist                                                     We identified 14 co-existing occurrences among 49 olivine-rich sites located around large impact basins                                                     The presence of co-existing occurrences may indicate material heterogeneity in the peak rings of impact basins},

  abstract = {Northwest Africa (NWA) 12384 is a lunar polymict breccia composed almost entirely of basaltic components. The clast content includes low- to very-low-Ti volcanic picritic glass, basaltic vitrophyre, and crystalline pigeonite basalt---an assemblage of volcanic materials that can be tested for petrogenetic relationships. We present the inferred history of select mare components of NWA 12384 as suggested by texture, mineralogy, and petrography, and compare them to Apollo samples and other lunar meteorites. In addition, we used the volcanic glasses in the breccia as a primary composition for crystallization modeling and comparison to the lithic clast compositions. We find that the mafic clasts in NWA 12384 cannot be derived from the picritic glass through a common liquid line of descent because of higher Ti content, though they may have crystallized from a separate, common liquid line of descent. These clasts could represent local source-region heterogeneity or differential assimilation of more Ti-rich material. Pb-Pb SIMS analyses of a large basalt clast in NWA 12384 reveal an age of 3044 {\textpm} 41 Ma (2{$\sigma$}), which is used together with the chemical data and 4{$\pi$} cosmic ray exposure age of less than 20 kyr and terrestrial age of between 3.1 and 17.3 kyr to constrain the possible locations of provenance for this meteorite.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing imagery is essential for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and disaster response. However, data loss due to cloud cover, sensor failures, or incomplete acquisition-especially in high-resolution and high-frequency tasks-severely limits satellite imagery's effectiveness. Traditional interpolation methods struggle with large missing areas and complex structures. Remote sensing imagery consists of multiple bands, each with distinct meanings, and ensuring consistency across bands is critical to avoid anomalies in the combined images. This paper proposes SatelliteMaker, a diffusion-based method that reconstructs missing data across varying levels of data loss while maintaining spatial, spectral, and temporal consistency. We also propose Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as a conditioning input and use tailored prompts to generate realistic images, making diffusion models applicable to quantitative remote sensing tasks. Additionally, we propose a VGG-Adapter module based on Distribution Loss, which reduces distribution discrepancy and ensures style consistency. Extensive experiments show that SatelliteMaker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.},

  abstract = {Mare basalts on the lunar surface are tangible expressions of the complex thermal evolution and geological processes that have occurred within the lunar interior. These basaltic manifestations are highly important because they provide invaluable insights into lunar geological evolution. Notably, the Oceanus Procellarum region, which is renowned for its extensive and long-lasting basaltic volcanism, is a premier location to investigate late-stage lunar thermal evolution. The primary aim of this research is to elucidate the geomorphological, compositional, and temporal attributes that define the mare basalts within the Oceanus Procellarum region. To achieve this aim, we comprehensively analyzed the geomorphological features present within the region, leveraging Kaguya/SELENE TC images and digital elevation models. Specifically, these geomorphological features encompass impact craters, wrinkle ridges, sinuous rilles, and volcanic domes. Subsequently, we thoroughly examined the mineralogical attributes of basalts in the Oceanus Procellarum region, leveraging Kaguya/SELENE MI data and compositional map products. To more accurately reflect the actual ages of the mare basalts in the Oceanus Procellarum region, we carefully delineated the geological units within the area and employed the latest crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) technique to precisely determine their ages. This refined approach allowed for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the basaltic rocks in the study area. Overall, our comprehensive study included an in-depth analysis of the volcanic activity and evolution of the Oceanus Procellarum region, along with an examination of the correlation between the mineralogical composition and ages of mare basalts. The findings from this exhaustive investigation reveal a definitive age range for basalt units within the Oceanus Procellarum region from approximately 3.69 Ga to 1.17 Ga. Moreover, the latest mare basalts that formed were pinpointed north of the Aristarchus crater. Significantly, the region has experienced at least five distinct volcanic events, occurring approximately 3.40 Ga, 2.92 Ga, 2.39 Ga, 2.07 Ga, and 1.43 Ga, leading to the formation of multiple basalt units characterized by their unique mineral compositions and elemental abundances. Through the application of remote sensing mineralogical analysis, three primary basalt types were identified: low-titanium, very-low-titanium, and intermediate-titanium basalt. Notably, the younger basalt units exhibit an elevated titanium proportion, indicative of progressive olivine enrichment. Consequently, these younger basalt units exhibit more intricate and complex mineral compositions, offering valuable insights into the dynamic geological processes shaping the lunar surface.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method of removing mismatches of redundant points based on oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) in vision simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. On the one hand, the grid-based motion statistics (GMS) algorithm reduces the processing time of key frames with more feature points and greatly increases the robustness of the original algorithm in a complex environment. On the other hand, aiming at the situation that the GMS algorithm is prone to false matching when there are few symmetry feature point pairs, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is used to optimize and correct it. Experiments show that the method we propose has an average error correction rate of 28.81\% for individual GMS while the time consumed at the same accuracy threshold is reduced by 72.18\% on average. At the same time, we compared it to locality preserving matching (LPM) and progressive sample consensus (PROSAC), and it performed the best. Finally, we integrated GMS-RANSAC into the ORB-SLAM2 system for monocular initialization, which results in a significant improvement.},

Here, we reveal diverse glasses from Chang'E-5 (CE-5) lunar regolith, and clarify their physical origins of liquid quenching, vapor deposition and irradiation damage respectively. The series of quenched glasses, including rotation-featured particles, vesicular agglutinates and adhered melts, record multiple-scale impact events. Abundant micro-impact products, like micron- to nano-scale glass droplets or craters, highlight that the regolith is heavily reworked by frequent micrometeorite bombardment. Distinct from Apollo samples, the indigenous ultra-elongated glass fibers drawn from viscous melts and the widespread ultra-thin deposited amorphous rims without nanophase iron particles both indicate a relatively gentle impact environment at the CE-5 landing site. The clarification of multitype CE-5 glasses also provides a catalogue of diverse lunar glasses, meaning that more of the Moon's mysteries, recorded in glasses, could be deciphered in future.},

The rocker and differential shaft fixed to the rocker are divided into three parts and reconnected via a novel angle-adjusting mechanism. The mechanism, which is driven by a single motor, widens and narrows the angle between the two rocker parts periodically to generate a wheel-step motion. Moreover, it adjusts the angle between a rocker part and differential shaft part to keep the bottom side of the rover body parallel to the ground. When fully stretched, the suspension lowers the bottom side horizontally to the lander platform. The mechanism also cooperates with a brake added between a rocker part and bogie to lift the sunken wheels separately. The strategies of wheel-step motion, wheel lifting, and suspension folding/unfolding are practicable as validated by prototype tests. Experiments show that the active suspension considerably enhances the rover's ability to escape from a dune or a crater. The proposed suspension is an important attempt in improving the design of Chinese Mars rovers.},

  abstract = {Vision transformers (ViTs) have been successfully applied in image classification tasks recently. In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks, the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6\% on ImageNet.

  abstract = {Abstract             Underground lava tubes are promising candidates for the construction of lunar bases because they are believed to offer good protection against radiation and harsh thermal environments on the lunar surface. Although the extent and structures of the underground lava tubes are uncertain, previously identified ``skylights'', believed to represent places where lava tube roofs have collapsed, may provide insights into tube structures. Unfortunately, owing to the steep slopes, considerable depth, and associated difficult illumination conditions, the availability of detailed morphologic models of these pits is limited. In this study, we reconstruct the topography of lava tube pits using a refined photogrammetric approach. We use improved census cost for disparity search, refined point cloud coarse-to-fine registration, and weighted fusion of point clouds from several matched stereo image pairs to obtain a high-resolution topographic model. Experiments are conducted for two prominent skylights, that is, the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit and the Marius Hills Hole, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Several LRO NAC image pairs are selected from images covering these two areas, and fused topographic models with a spatial resolution of 2~ are generated. The quality of our generated topographic models is validated against terrain products provided by the LROC team. Compared to these previous models, our model is generated based on a much denser point cloud and provides better coverage and more details. Benefiting from the detailed three-dimensional models, morphological analysis is carried out to investigate the geometric dimensions (e.g., depth, diameters, slopes) of the lava tube pits.           ,              Key Points                                                                Topographic models of two typical lunar lava tube pits are generated with a high spatial resolution of 2~m                                                     A refined photogrammetric approach is proposed to cope with slopes and steep walls associated with lava tube pits                                                     Leveraging detailed three-dimensional models, morphological analysis is conducted to explore the geometric dimensions of the lava tube pits},

On the terrain of soft lunar regolith, the rover wheels are easy to slip, sink, or even fail to move. To improve the traction performance of the rover on soft lunar soil, it is necessary to study the interaction between the wheels and the lunar soil. The deformation of the flexible wheel provides a larger contact area, which results in greater tractive force. Moreover, flexible wheels have better comfort and stability than rigid wheels, which are needed for manned rovers. However, there are few studies on the wheel soil interaction model of the heavy flexible wheel for the pressurized lunar rover. In this paper, a metal flexible wheel soil interaction model for pressurized lunar rovers was established, and the traction performance of the flexible wheel was predicted by using this model. Then, the accuracy of the wheel soil interaction model was verified by the soil bin test. The experimental results showed that the average error between the theoretical value of sinkage and the experimental value was 13.9\%, and the average error between the theoretical and experimental value of drawbar pull was 11.5\%, indicating that the model has high prediction accuracy. The new model can be used to predict the traction performance of flexible wheels and the experimental results can provide a reference for the flexible wheel design lunar rovers.},
